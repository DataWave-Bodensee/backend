Criticism mounted over Europe’s yearslong failure to prevent such tragedies.

Patrol boats and a helicopter spent a third day scouring the area of the Mediterranean Sea where the packed fishing vessel capsized early Wednesday, in what the U.N. migration agency said could be the second deadliest migrant shipwreck recorded. The deadliest occurred when a vessel capsized off the coast of Libya en route to Italy in April 2015, killing an estimated 1,100 people.

Greek coast guard spokesman Nikos Alexiou said that both coast guard and private ships repeatedly offered by radio and loudspeaker to help the vessel Wednesday while it was in international waters, also heading from Libya to Italy, but they were rejected.

Alexiou argued that any effort to tow the overcrowded trawler or move hundreds of unwilling people onto nearby ships would have been too dangerous.

“Υou will have a disturbance, and the people will surge — which, unfortunately is what happened in the end,” Alexiou told state-run ERT TV. “You will have caused the accident.”

Alexiou also said that, after accepting food from a merchant ship, the trawler’s passengers rejected a rope bringing more from a second merchant ship “because they thought the whole process was a way for us to take them to Greece.”

Greek authorities sent the first ship, the tanker Lucky Sailor, to give the migrants food and water. The company managing the tanker said Friday that the people on board “were very hesitant to receive any assistance, and at any attempt of approach the boat started to maneuver away.”

Eastern Mediterranean Maritime Limited said in a statement that the people on the trawler were eventually persuaded to accept supplies.

Experts said maritime law obligated Greek authorities to attempt a rescue.

They definitely “had a duty to start rescue procedures” given the condition of the vessel, said Professor Erik Røsæg of the University of Oslo’s Institute of Private Law. He said a refusal of assistance can be overruled if deemed unreasonable, as it appeared to have been on Wednesday.

Flavio Di Giacomo of the Mediterranean office of the U.N. migration agency IOM tweeted that all migrant boats should be considered dangerous and rescued immediately because “even when they appear to have no problems, in a few minutes they can sink.”

Rescuers pulled 104 survivors from the water and later recovered 78 bodies but have not located any more since late Wednesday. The Greek coast guard said the search-and-rescue operation would continue beyond the standard 72 hours.

The U.N.'s migration and refugee agencies issued a joint statement calling timely maritime search and rescues “a legal and humanitarian imperative” and calling for “urgent and decisive action to prevent further deaths at sea.”

A group of nongovernmental organizations, including Amnesty International and Doctors Without Borders, said the EU should “stop seeing solutions solely in the dismantling” of smuggling networks, and set up state-led search-and-rescue operations in the Mediterranean..

“The Greek government had specific responsibilities toward every passenger on the vessel, which was clearly in distress,” Adriana Tidona of Amnesty International said. “This is a tragedy of unimaginable proportions, all the more so because it was entirely preventable.”

Greece and other southern EU nations that typically are the first destinations for Europe-bound asylum-seekers traveling by sea have toughened border protection measures in recent years, extending walls and intensifying maritime patrols.

“This is a European problem. I think it’s time for Europe to be able, in solidarity, to define an effective migration policy for these kinds of situations not to happen again,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said during a news conference at U.N. headquarters in New York late Thursday.

The EU’s executive commission says the 27-nation bloc is close to an agreement on how member countries can share responsibility in caring for migrants and refugees who undertake the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean.

A judicial investigation is also underway into the causes of the sinking. Greek officials say the vessel capsized minutes after it lost power, speculating that panic among the passengers may have caused the boat to list and roll over.

Most of the survivors were being moved Friday from a storage hangar at the southern port of Kalamata, where relatives also gathered to look for loved ones, to migrant shelters near Athens.

Abdo Sheikhi, a Kurdish Syrian living in Germany, traveled to Kalamata to find out what happened to five family members who were on the boat.

On Friday, he discovered that only his younger brother Ali and another relative had survived. He managed to speak on the phone to Ali, who has been moved to the camp near Athens.

“(Ali) told me he jumped (off the) ship while the others could not jump,” Sheikhi said. “They were scared. They were holding on to the boat as it swayed.”

Nine people — all men from Egypt, ranging in age from 20 to 40 — were arrested and detained and charged Friday of people smuggling and participating in a criminal enterprise. Twenty-seven of the survivors remain hospitalized, health officials said. The smuggling suspects are due to appear in court Monday.

The IOM has estimated the boat carried as many as 750 people, and U.N. human rights office spokesman Jeremy Laurence said the missing included “large numbers of women and children.”

The survivors were all boys and men from Egypt, Pakistan, Syria and the Palestinian territories. Alexiou, citing survivor accounts, said passengers in the hold of the fishing boat included women and children but that the number of missing, believed to be in the hundreds, still remained unclear.

Officials at a state-run morgue outside Athens photographed the faces of the victims and gathered DNA samples to start the identification process.

Late Friday, Greece’s coast guard said a navy helicopter located a sailboat with migrants off southwestern Greece after being alerted by Italian authorities. It said three merchant ships had reached the vessel, which reported no trouble and was heading for Italy. ERT TV said about 60 people were believed to be on board.

1,Greek migrant boat wreck may be Mediterranean’s ‘worst ever tragedy’ with hundreds still missing - CNN,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8xNy93b3JsZC9ncmVlY2UtYm9hdC13b3JzdC1ldmVyLXRyYWdlZHktbWVkaXRlcnJhbmVhbi1zZWEtaW50bC1obmsvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBYmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjMvMDYvMTcvd29ybGQvZ3JlZWNlLWJvYXQtd29yc3QtZXZlci10cmFnZWR5LW1lZGl0ZXJyYW5lYW4tc2VhLWludGwtaG5r?oc=5,"Sat, 17 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT","CNN —

The sinking of a packed migrant boat off the coast of Greece may be “the worst tragedy ever” in the Mediterranean sea, according to the EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson.

Dozens of people were killed and hundreds more left missing when the boat, traveling from the coastal city of Tobruk in Libya to Italy, capsized off the coast of Greece earlier this week. The true toll of the disaster is yet to become clear.

“We don’t have all information yet on what has happened but it seems like this is the worst ever tragedy we’ve seen in the Mediterranean,” she told a press conference in Brussels on Friday.

The tragedy has shone a spotlight on the EU refugee crisis in which every year, tens of thousands of migrants fleeing war, persecution, climate change and poverty risk treacherous routes to Europe.

Johansson condemned the role of “smugglers” who put people on the boats. “They are not sending them to Europe, they are sending them to death. This is what they’re doing and it’s absolutely necessary to prevent it,” she said.

“Unfortunately, we have seen this coming because since the start of the year, there was a new modus operandi with these fishing boats leaving from the eastern part of Libya… and we’ve seen an increase of 600% of these departures this year,” she added, stressing the need to find “different ways to fight the smugglers and save lives.”

“When it comes to fighting the smugglers, we can’t rely on only one way to do that. We have to use intelligence – we have to use common police investigations together with countries of origin, with countries of transit, with countries of departure,” she said.

Other global bodies such as the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) called for “urgent and decisive action” to prevent further deaths in the Mediterranean and emphasized “the duty to rescue people in distress at sea without delay.”

Denial from authorities

Greek authorities have faced criticism for how the disaster was handled.

On Friday, they denied claims that the boat had capsized after the coast guard attempted to tow it to shore.

Authorities had initially said the coast guard kept its distance but their assistance “had been declined” after they threw a rope to the vessel to “stabilize and check if it needed help.”

Tarek Aldroobi, who had three relatives on board, told CNN that they had seen Greek authorities towing the vessel with ropes, but says they were tied in the “wrong places” – which caused it to capsize.

“Their boat was in a good condition and the Greek navy tried towing them to the beach but the ropes were tied in the wrong places,” Aldroobi said. “When the Greek navy tried pulling them it caused the boat to capsize.”

Speaking to Greek national broadcaster ERT, government spokesperson Ilias Siakanderis said the coast guard arrived two hours before the boat capsized after its engine broke down and there had been “no connection” between the two.

“The engine broke down at 1:40 a.m. and at 2:00 a.m. it sank – therefore there can be no connection between (the coast guard approaching the boat and the time of its sinking),” he told ERT.

The Hellenic coast guard also defended its response.

“When the boat capsized, we were not even next to boat. How could we be towing it?” Nikos Alexiou, a spokesman for the coast guard told CNN.

Alexiou said their patrol boat only used a small rope to stabilize itself while it was close to the migrant boat hours earlier when they approached to check its condition, but they were not equipped to tow it.

“Let’s not mix up the big boats, specialized rescue boats, that have specialized ropes to tow boats. Our patrol boat could not tow the fishing boat,” he said.

According to Alexiou the coast guard had been observing the boat at close but not mooring distance, when they started approaching following an alert that the migrant boat’s engine had failed.

“Regretfully there was movement of people, a shift in weight probably caused by panic and the boat capsized. As soon as we got there, we started our rescue operation to collect those who were in the water,” he explained.

The NGO Alarm Phone meanwhile alleged that the coast guard was aware that the boat was in distress hours before it capsized.

The coast guard this week said it had repeatedly asked the boat if it needed assistance and were told it did not. Authorities also previously said they could not intervene with the boat without being asked for assistance, as the boat was in international waters."

Naysayers, Mitsotakis said at a campaign stop in the town of Sparta, should turn their ire against traffickers he called “human scum.” The vessel sank on Wednesday.

The Greek coast guard announced Saturday that one Greek Navy frigate and four other vessels were operating 47 nautical miles (54 miles; 87 kilometers) southwest of the town of Pylos in Greece’s southwest. Earlier, two helicopters from the navy and coast guard joined the operation, the coast guard said.

The rescue operation is taking place in rough seas, with near gale-force winds, and in some of the Mediterranean Sea’s deepest waters. at over 5,000 meters (3 miles).

To date, 104 survivors have been rescued and 78 bodies have been recovered. The trawler carried as many as 750 men, women and children from Syria, Egypt, the Palestinian territories and Pakistan. No survivors or bodies have been found since the day of the accident.

The survivors have been taken to a migrant reception center outside Athens. A few have been visited by relatives residing in other European countries.

The Egyptian embassy in Athens on Saturday shared a list of 43 Egyptian migrants, including minors, who survived the shipwreck. The survivors are all men from Cairo and the Nile Delta provinces of Sharqia and Menofia, the list shows. The embassy said the list was provided by Greek authorities.

Greek authorities continue to face criticism, however, over their failure to act more quickly. They say the migrants insisted they didn’t need any help, but non-governmental organizations say they received a number of calls for help.

On Saturday, parts of the Greek rescue vessel captain’s testimony were published by Greek media. In it he said the migrants refused help, saying they were going to Italy, and untied a rope loosely tied to the trawler’s bow when the coast guard ship had gone closer to inspect.

“It is very unfair for some so-called ‘people in solidarity’ to insinuate that the (Coast Guard) did not do its job. … These people are out there battling the waves to rescue human lives and protect our borders,” Mitsotakis said.

Mitsotakis, the favorite to win a second four-year term in elections on June 25, attacked the main opposition party Syriza for its own record on migration while in government.

“Those who today appear as the so-called authentic humanitarians are those who allowed detention camps such as Moria to exist. The same who, a few days ago, were condemned by the European Court of Human Rights for the wretched conditions at Moria.”

The notoriously overcrowded migrant camp of Moria, on the island of Lesbos across from the Turkish coast, opened in January 2013 under a three-party coalition government led by New Democracy. It saw its population swell during the migration crisis of 2015. It operated throughout the Syriza administration from 2015-19 and burned down in September 2020. Just before it did, it was estimated that 20,000 people lived in a camp designed to accommodate 3,000.

Mitsotakis also attacked Syriza for “opening the doors to millions of people” in 2015 and defended his own more restrictive policies, vowing to continue them.

“We followed a different migration policy … fair and strict, of monitoring and guarding our borders. A policy which resulted in illegal crossings dropping 90 percent,” he told the crowd. “This policy has been acknowledged (by Europe) as the right one. Because if we leave Europe’s borders to allow in everyone, then the numbers of those wanting to cross the Mediterranean will rise exponentially and so will the chances of tragic shipwrecks.”

Separately on Saturday, a successful rescue operation took place in Italy, where a coast guard vessel from the port of Roccella, in Calabria, rescued 96 migrants on a sailboat more than 100 nautical miles (115 miles; 185 kilometers) from the port.

Turbulent seas made the rescue difficult but with the assistance of a Portuguese coast guard vessel operating for Frontex, the European Union’s border agency, and several commercial vessels, the rescue was completed.

3,Timeline: How the migrant boat tragedy unfolded off Greece - Al Jazeera English,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzYvMTYvdGltZWxpbmUtaG93LXRoZS1yZWZ1Z2VlLWJvYXQtdHJhZ2VkeS11bmZvbGRlZC1vZmYtZ3JlZWNl0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWxqYXplZXJhLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy8yMDIzLzYvMTYvdGltZWxpbmUtaG93LXRoZS1yZWZ1Z2VlLWJvYXQtdHJhZ2VkeS11bmZvbGRlZC1vZmYtZ3JlZWNl?oc=5,"Fri, 16 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT","Greek authorities say they were notified of the boat’s presence but those onboard repeatedly refused offers for help.

Greek authorities have been accused of failing to rescue hundreds of refugees and migrants onboard a vessel that sunk near the coastal town of Pylos, causing one of the biggest tragedies in the Mediterranean Sea.

Reports suggest as many as 750 people were packed onto the fishing boat that capsized early on Wednesday in deep waters about 80km (50 miles) off the southern Peloponnese peninsula.

At least 78 bodies have been recovered and 104 people rescued. Hundreds are still missing.

The Greek coastguard was alerted to the presence of the vessel about 10am (08:00 GMT) on Tuesday. It capsized later that evening.

Exactly what happened in the intervening hours remains unclear.

Alarm Phone, a self-organised hotline for refugees in distress in the Mediterranean Sea, says the boat had reported being in trouble, but Greek authorities say it repeatedly refused offers of help.

Here is a timeline of the events that occurred on Tuesday, according to statements issued by Alarm Phone and Greek authorities:

9:53am (07:53 GMT): Activist Nawal Soufi, based in Italy, alerts Alarm Phone of a large boat in distress carrying 750 people. Over the following hours, Soufi sends additional information, including the GPS position of the vessel. She says authorities in Italy, Greece and Malta were alerted.

12:47 pm (10:47 GMT): A surveillance aircraft from the European Border and Coast Guard Agency Frontex spots the overcrowded trawler at and notifies Greek authorities.

The Greek coastguard confirms it was notified of the boat’s presence late on Tuesday morning.

2:17pm (12:17 GMT): Alarm Phone receives the first call from the boat. Its passengers say they are in distress and “cannot survive the night”. The call drops before the GPS coordinates can be confirmed.

Greek authorities say in their statement that they established contact with someone on the trawler at around 2pm. The vessel “did not request any assistance from the Coast Guard or from Greece,” they say.

3:35pm (1:35 GMT): A Greek Coast Guard helicopter located the trawler. An aerial photo released showed it packed, with people covering almost every inch of the deck. Some had their hands outstretched.

4:13pm (14:13 GMT): After a number of failed attempts at communicating with the boat, Alarm Phone receives the coordinates.

4:53pm (14:53 GMT): The organisation alerts the Greek authorities via email as well as other actors, including the EU border agency, Frontex, and UN refugee agency in Greece.

5:10pm (15:10 GMT): Greek authorities ask a Maltese-flagged tanker called the Lucky Sailor to bring the trawler food and water.

According to the company that manages the Lucky Sailor, people on the boat “were very hesitant to receive any assistance,” and shouted that “they want to go to Italy.”

Eastern Mediterranean Maritime Limited said in a statement that the trawler was later persuaded to accept supplies.

5:20pm (15:20 GMT): The passengers call Alarm Phone saying the boat is not moving and the captain fled on a smaller boat. They add that they need food and water.

6:30pm (16:30 GMT): The Greek coastguard says it observed the boat by helicopter and it was “sailing on a steady course”.

Greek officials say they were faced with a dilemma on what to do with a vessel that had repeatedly declined offers of assistance as they worried that even the slightest shift could unbalance the boat.

6:55pm (16:55 GMT): Soufi writes that migrants on board tell her six people died and another two were very sick. No other account has mentioned deaths prior to the shipwreck.

8:05pm (18:05 GMT): Alarm Phone is informed by the passengers that they received water from the merchant vessel Lucky Sailor and they have been in contact with the police. Alarm Phone also notices that a second merchant vessel, the Faithful Warrior, is close to the boat.

9:00pm (19:00 GMT): Greek authorities say they asked a second, Greek-flagged, merchant vessel to deliver water, and allowed the Lucky Sailor to leave.

10:40pm (20:40 GMT): A Coast Guard boat from Crete reaches the trawler and remains nearby until it sank. According to the Coast Guard, the vessel “discreetly observed” the trawler from a distance. Once again, the Coast Guard said, the trawler did not appear to have any problems and was moving “at a steady course and speed.”

11:00pm (21:00 GMT): Shortly after 11pm, Soufi writes that the trawler began rocking as its passengers tried to catch water bottles from another vessel. According to people on board, ropes were tied to the ship, destabilising it and causing a “state of panic,” she said.

12:46am Wednesday (22:46 GMT): Alarm Phone reports its last contact with the boat in distress. All it hears is: “Hello, my friend. … The ship you send is …” The call cuts off.

The Greek coastguard says merchant ships delivered supplies and observed the vessel until the morning when the satellite phone user reports a problem with the engine.

About 40 minutes later, according to the coastguard statement, the vessel began to rock violently and sank.

The Greek coastguard says the boat’s engine stopped working shortly before 1am on Wednesday (23:00 GMT Tuesday) and the vessel later capsized, sinking in about 10 to 15 minutes.

Who says what?

Coastguard experts believe the boat may have run out of fuel or experienced engine trouble and the movement of passengers caused it to list and capsize.

They suggest the boat might have capsized earlier had they attempted to intervene.

But Greece’s leftist former Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras says the passengers had “called for help”.

“What sort of protocol does not call for the rescue … of an overloaded boat about to sink?” he asked.

Soufi says in a reconstruction posted on Facebook that the Greek coastguard had been towing the ship before it capsized.

According to messages between Soufi and the passengers, the Greek coastguard tied a rope to the fishing vessel.

The activist said later in a voice memo that “they never expressed the will to continue sailing to Italy,” or refused assistance from Greece. “They were in danger and needed help.”

Greek parliamentarian Kriton Arsenis, who spoke to some survivors in Kalamata, confirms the account and accuses the coastguard of trying to move the boat into Italian waters.

Greek authorities did not mention any attempt to tow the boat in their statements following the shipwreck.

The report from the Lucky Sailor said no lines were tied to the trawler, and supplies were delivered in watertight barrels tied to a rope.

Commander Nikos Alexiou told Greek channel Ant1 TV that the Coast Guard wanted to check on the trawler’s condition, but people on board again refused help and untied the rope before continuing course."

Kassem Abozeed had arrived in Kalamata to try to find his wife and brother-in-law, as relatives poured into the Greek port city on Thursday, searching for their loved ones missing after a migrant boat sank off the coast, killing dozens of people.

The 34-year-old refugee fled from the Syrian civil war to Hamburg, Germany, in 2016. He told reporters that his 21-year-old partner, Ezma, and her 19-year-old sibling, Abdullah, were two of the passengers caught up in one of the largest-scale migrant vessel disasters in southern Europe this year.

“I tried to get my wife to come to Germany but it was very difficult to do so in a legal way. So we tried through Libya,” Abozeed said.

“The last time we spoke was eight days ago and she told me she was ready to get on the boat. She paid $5,000.”

He reflected on his relationship with his wife. “It was a love story.”

Family members gathering at the port in southern Greece, as hopes for survivors fade and the scale of the tragedy starts to sink in.

At least 78 people died after the vessel went down on Wednesday, with campaigners warning there could have been hundreds more on board, meaning the death toll could rise.

A total of 104 passengers were rescued and sent to Kalamata, as emergency workers struggled to contain the fallout.

Authorities warned the likelihood of finding survivors was waning, because the boat sank in “very deep” waters.

“A sudden shift in weight is likely to be the cause of what led the boat to capsize and then sink,” Hellenic Coast Guard spokesman Nikos Alexiou told CNN on Thursday.

“As the incident took place at very deep waters it is not clear how operations will continue beyond the current stage.”

Rescuers were likely to wind down their search for survivors soon, according to Thanasis Vasilopoulos, the mayor of Kalamata. “It’s hard to see search and rescue operations going on for much longer,” he said. “Unfortunately, we have not found any survivors today. The waters in the area where the incident happened are very deep. It is hard to imagine finding survivors by now.”

The people rescued – all of whom are men – include 43 Egyptian nationals, 47 Syrian nationals, 12 Pakistani nationals, and two Palestinians, the Hellenic Coast Guard said. Eight of those rescued were minors.

There were an estimated 750 passengers on the ship, including at least 40 children, according to a spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration.

“If these numbers were confirmed, it would be the second most serious shipwreck in the Mediterranean,” Flavio Di Giacomo tweeted.

The Mediterranean region near Greece is a key route for migrants and refugees attempting to flee political strife in the Middle East, Asia and Africa.

The number of undocumented people arriving on European shores has soared this year due to conflict, global inequality and the climate crisis, exacerbating a migrant crisis across the continent.

More than 36,000 people arrived in the Mediterranean from January to March this year, nearly twice the number compared with the same period in 2022, according to figures from the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR).

The capsized ship had set off from the port city of Tobruk, in Libya, state broadcaster ERT reported. It was traveling to Italy, Greek officials said.

Poor communication lines marred initial efforts to contact the boat, which received water from a merchant vessel on Tuesday evening local time after the first distress call.

‘State of anxiety’

Emergency volunteers described frantic scenes on Thursday, as they tried to comfort traumatized survivors sheltering in a makeshift warehouse in Kalamata.

Hypocrates Efstathiou, a social worker for the Greek NGO IASIS, said the mental state of those rescued was “intense.”

“They are in great need of support. People are still in shock. They have been describing their attempts to survive. And they are asking for relatives. From their accounts there seem to have been women and children on board,” he told CNN while helping survivors on the ground.

Dimitris Chaliotis, a volunteer for the Hellenic Red Cross said he had “never seen a rescue operation like this one before. It is a tragedy,” according to a statement from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

Another rescue volunteer, Maria Triantou, said many of the survivors were in “a state of anxiety,” following the incident.

“These people had not eaten for many days, had not drunk water for many days, were burnt by the sun,” the Greek Rescue Team member told CNN affiliate CNN Greece.

Triantou told CNN the men were “dehydrated and had some breathing problems, but things [are] now normalizing.”

Once the survivors started recovering, fear and panic kicked in, she added. “Now they want to know what happened to others, including family members.”

CNN saw several people arriving at the port looking for relatives.

One man who said he was Egyptian but refused to speak to press briefly explained he had come to look for his cousin. He was nervously peering behind the fenced area of the port warehouse, where survivors are temporarily resting.

They are expected to be transferred to a larger facility in greater Athens, local authorities said.

‘Failure of the international community’

Humanitarian bodies said the boat disaster was a damning indictment on the inability of EU countries to create “safe pathways to protection” for refugees.

IFRC operations manager Frido Herinckx stressed how “heart-wrenching and simply unacceptable that these people, who were seeking safety and a better future, have died at the EU borders in 2023.”

The first quarter of 2023 was already “the deadliest on record on the Central Mediterranean route and this tragedy could be one of the worst ever as the search for the missing continues,” Herinckx said.

“Every one of the lives lost should be on our collective conscience due to the failure to provide safe pathways to protection.”

IFRC President Francesco Rocca described the shipwreck as an “the icon of the failure of the international community.”

“It is shocking and unacceptable that people are still dying in front of EU borders, seeking a safe place,” Rocca tweeted Thursday."

Up to 500 people are missing after an overcrowded fishing boat carrying migrants capsized in the Mediterranean Sea, the United Nations has said.

Authorities rescued 104 people and recovered 78 bodies in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, but nothing has been found since.

Witness accounts suggested 400-700 people had packed the 20-30m-long trawler, which capsized and sank about 50 miles from the southern coastal town of Pylos as it was travelling from Libya to Italy.

A Greek social worker, who looked after some of the survivors, told us she had heard that water ran out on the boat days before it sank, forcing passengers to drink their own urine and suck water from the melting refrigerators.

Many of them are suffering severe mental trauma.

She recalled one survivor who told her that ""for two hours he was swimming surrounded by the bodies of children"" and a young man in his 20s who ""wanted to commit suicide, wanted to jump into the sea and kill himself because he couldn't take it anymore"".

The survivors have been moved to an immigration centre in central Greece.

The media attention has shifted to the Hellenic Coastguard office in the port of Kalamata as questions are now arising over whether they could have done more to avert the disaster.

One Greek newspaper quoted an anonymous source claiming that a rope had been attached to the boat around three hours before it capsized.

There are also questions about why nothing was done to rescue at least some of the passengers when it was obvious the boat was dangerously overcrowded, with migrants onboard and therefore almost certainly people smugglers too.

At least 78 people died when the fishing vessel flipped and capsized in international waters southwest of Greece early on Wednesday.

“While the number of people onboard the boat which capsized on June 14 off the coast of Greece is not clear, it is believed to have been somewhere between 400 and 750, according to various testimonies,” International Organization for Migration (IOM), and UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency said in a statement.

“So far 104 people have been rescued and 78 bodies retrieved, while hundreds remain missing, and feared dead. The boat was reportedly in distress since the morning of June 13,” the statement added.

A large-scale search and rescue operation was announced by the Hellenic Coast Guard on the morning of June 14, after the Greece boat accident.

— IOM – UN Migration 🇺🇳 (@UNmigration) June 16, 2023

In a statement, UN agencies said that both shipmasters and States have an obligation to render assistance to those in distress at sea regardless of their nationality, status or the circumstances in which they are found.

“Any action carried out with regard to search and rescue should be conducted in a manner consistent with the obligation to prevent loss of life at sea,” the statement added.

Two Greek sources familiar with police inquiries say that, based on accounts from about 30 survivors, the ageing fishing vessel left Tobruk, in Libya, early on June 10.

Passengers paid USD 4,500 for passage to Italy, the two Greek sources said. Based on some accounts, there were about 20 women and children among the passengers. They booked their voyage on social media, according to a maritime ministry official.

Traffickers had promised ample room on the vessel, but once passengers arrived at the scheduled departure point and saw it was overcrowded it was impossible to turn back, those sources said.

Over the next few days at sea the boat developed “two or three” mechanical faults. When the boat reported engine failure and stalled, a coastguard vessel shadowing them came closer.

In just under 25 minutes, coastguard witnesses saw the boat tilt sharply right to left. In 10 to 15 minutes, the boat was gone.

The precise number of victims might never be known. The waters in which the boat sank are some of the deepest in the Mediterranean, where depths can exceed 5 km.

IOM and UNHCR welcomed the investigation that has been ordered in Greece into the circumstances which eventually led to the boat capsizing and the loss of so many lives.

UN agencies reiterated that search and rescue at sea is a legal and humanitarian imperative.

“It is clear, that the current approach to the Mediterranean is unworkable. Year after year, it continues to be the most dangerous migration route in the world, with the highest fatality rate,” said Federico Soda, IOM Director for the Department of Emergencies.

“States need to come together and address the gaps in proactive search and rescue, quick disembarkation, and safe regular pathways,” Soda added.

Nine men have been arrested for people smuggling.

Hundreds of men, women and children were in the boat's hull and were unable to escape.

Greek rescuers on Thursday scoured the Ionian Sea for survivors a day after a fishing boat overloaded with migrants capsized and sank, killing at least 78 people, as police arrested nine suspected people smugglers.





Fears were growing meanwhile that the final toll could eventually run into the hundreds.





""We are witnessing one of the biggest tragedies in the Mediterranean and the numbers announced by the authorities are devastating,"" the UN International Organization for Migration said.



READ MORE Hundreds feared dead in one of Europe's deadliest shipping disasters as migrant boat sinks

As frantic relatives in the migrants' home countries sought details of loved ones, the coastguard said 78 bodies had been recovered and 104 people saved from the sea so far.





Police on Thursday arrested nine Egyptians on suspicion of people smuggling, one of them the captain of the boat carrying the migrants.





They were arrested at the port of Kalamata, where the survivors are being cared for, said Greek news agency ANA.



A survivor told hospital doctors in Kalamata he had seen a hundred children in the boat's hold, ERT reported.





""It's really horrific,"" UN refugee agency UNHCR staffer Erasmia Roumana told AFP. The survivors were ""in a very bad psychological situation"".





""Many are under shock, they are so overwhelmed,"" she said. ""Many of them worry about the people they travelled with, families or friends.""



Scores of people covering practically every free stretch of deck on a battered fishing boat that later capsized and sank off southern Greece are feared to be dead. The vessel capsized and sank off Greece on Wednesday leaving at least 79 dead and hundreds more missing in one of the worst disasters of its kind this year. Source: AAP / Hellenic Coast Guard Photographs handed out by the coastguard showed a rusty blue boat with scores of people crammed on deck.





""It was like an abandoned ship... we saw no lifesavers or lifejackets either on (the migrants) or the boat,"" local rescuer Constantinos Vlachonikolos told Proto Programma radio.





""We've never seen anything like this before.""



'I need my mother'

""One young man started to cry and said, I need my mother... This voice is inside my ears. And will always be inside,"" Red Cross nurse Ekaterini Tsata told AFP.





Around 30 people were hospitalised with pneumonia, dehydration and exhaustion but are not in immediate danger, officials said.





Some of those rescued are under 18.



""The fishing boat was 25-30 metres long. Its deck was full of people, and we assume the interior was just as full,"" coastguard spokesman Nikolaos Alexiou told ERT.





Government spokesman Ilias Siakantaris on Wednesday said there were unconfirmed reports that up to 750 people had been on the boat.





He said a common tactic used by smugglers was to ""lock people up to maintain control"".



In a telegram, Pope Francis offered ""heartfelt prayers for the many migrants who have died, their loved ones and all those traumatised.





But Doctors without Border (MSF) said the disaster was entirely preventable.





""What happened is the consequence of the absence of safe and legal pathways to come to Europe,"" said Juan Matias Gil, of MSF Sea.



Questions over rescue

The coastguard said a surveillance plane with Europe's Frontex agency had spotted the boat on Tuesday afternoon, but that the passengers had ""refused any help"".





The boat's engine gave up shortly before 23:00 GMT on Tuesday and the vessel later capsized, Mr Siakantaris said, sinking in around 10 to 15 minutes.





Mr Alexiou, the coastguard spokesman, suggested that the boat might have capsized earlier if the coastguard had attempted to intervene.





""You cannot divert a boat with so many people on board by force unless there is cooperation,"" he said.

It was ""fortunate"" that rescue ships were nearby or more lives would have been lost, he added.





But leftist former prime minister Alexis Tsipras, who spoke to survivors at the port, said they had ""called for help"".





""What sort of protocol does not call for the rescue... of an overloaded boat about to sink?"" he asked.

Migrants headed for Italy

Officials say the migrants had departed from Libya and had been headed for Italy.





The survivors, mainly from Syria, Egypt and Pakistan, are being housed in a port warehouse at Kalamata.





Acting migration minister Daniel Esdras said the survivors would eventually be taken to Malakasa migrant camp near Athens by Friday. Greece would examine their asylum claims, but those not entitled to protection would be sent home, he added.

12,298 Pakistanis feared dead as Greece hunts for migrant shipwreck's survivors - The Nation,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXRpb24uY29tLnBrLzE3LUp1bi0yMDIzLzI5OC1wYWtpc3RhbmlzLWZlYXJlZC1kZWFkLTEyLW90aGVycy1yZXNjdWVkLWFzLWdyZWVjZS1odW50cy1mb3ItbWlncmFudC1zaGlwd3JlY2stcy1zdXJ2aXZvcnPSAQA?oc=5,"Sat, 17 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT","Rescuers were scouring the seas off Greece on Saturday in a massive search operation as hopes dwindled for survivors of a shipwreck that estimatedly killed 298 Pakistan nationals.

The ship was carrying 310 Pakistan nationals along with other migrants when it met the accident earlier this week. The Pakistan embassy in Greece has confirmed that 12 of the citizens had been rescued, adding that the local authorities had managed to recover 78 bodies as search operation continues for fourth day.

The embassy said the identity of the bodies was yet to be confirmed. It asked the families in Pakistan, whose beloved ones were on the boat, to send verified reports of their DNA tests for crossmatch.

Sources said over 130 Paksitanis belonged to the Kashmir region.

Earlier on Wednesday, hundreds of people were thought to have packed a fishing boat that capsized in international waters about 50 miles (80 km) from the southern coastal town of Pylos, while being shadowed by the Greek coast guard.

As dawn broke on Thursday, a coast guard vessel sailed into the nearby port city of Kalamata, transferring victims of the year's deadliest shipwreck off Greece. By the early hours, the survivors there numbered 104 out of several hundreds.

Authorities said it was unclear how many had been aboard the vessel, and they were investigating one account from a European rescue-support charity that there could have been 750 people on the 20- to 30 metre-long (65- to 100- foot-long) boat. The U.N.'s International Organization for Migration said initial reports suggested up to 400 people were aboard.

Government officials said the vessel had set off from the Libyan port of Tobruk, but added that migrants on the boat had persistently refused offers of help from Greek authorities.

""It was a fishing boat packed with people who refused our assistance because they wanted to go to Italy,"" coast guard spokesperson Nikos Alexiou told broadcaster Skai TV.

""We stayed beside it in case it needed our assistance which they had refused.""

Aerial pictures released by the Greek coast guard showed dozens of people on the boat's upper and lower decks looking up, some with arms outstretched, hours before it sank.

Greece is one of the main routes into the European Union for refugees and migrants from the Middle East, Asia and Africa.

Under a conservative government, in power until last month, authorities have taken a harder stance on migration, building walled camps and boosting border controls.

Libya, which has had little stability or security since a NATO-backed uprising in 2011, is a major launching point for those seeking to reach Europe by sea.

People-smuggling networks are mainly run by military factions that control coastal areas.

The United Nations has registered more than 20,000 deaths and disappearances in the central Mediterranean since 2014, making it the most dangerous migrant crossing in the world."

Nayantara Bibi, 16, packed a jar of pickled dried fish, a few rotis, and dry torkari for her husband, Abbasuddin Sheikh, 21. The rotis and vegetable were intended to last him during his train ride from Kolkata to Chennai, and the pickled dried fish, for a couple of months of his stay there. Leaving behind his family of four — his wife, 5-month-old child, ageing mother, and 21-year-old brother who lived with autism — Abbasuddin prepared to leave his village Chousutti Para for Chennai, recalls his wife. Joining seven others from his village inKakdwip, a town in South 24 Parganas, he boarded a toto for ‘5 number bajaar’ from where they would take a bus to Dharmatala and another bus to reach Shalimar Station in Kolkata. The train would head to Chennai Central, in a journey lasting 26.5 hours, covering 1,659 km.

Like many before him, Abbasuddin left with the promise of returning after six months and sending money every month, with an extra ₹1,000 for his wife and new mother, Ms. Bibi. Two of the seven who left, came back to the village in an ambulance from Balasore, the site of the accident. They were the survivors of the Coromandel Express train tragedy that killed 288 people and injured over 1,000. Five, who boarded the general compartment of the train, went missing. One was Abbasuddin. He did not have a reservation on a train, the general compartment of which is meant to carry about 100 people but actually holds about 400, cramped onto the berths, standing or sitting on the floor. Undocumented, his name does not feature on the list of people — dead or alive — who could be identified. His brother-in-law spent over a week in Balasore, but could not identify his body. “We went to the morgues and hospitals, but could not find him anywhere,” says Rahul Sheikh.

Over the past two decades, the districts of low development in West Bengal, like North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas, Uttar Dinajpur, Malda, and Murshidabad have become hotspots for people leaving to work in States like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Kerala, says Abhijit Mistry, an assistant professor in Manipur University, Imphal, who specialises in migration and population studies, and grew up in the Sundarbans. Many, like Abbasuddin go to work as construction workers, but there are also those who go as agricultural labour. All go in search of a stable income.

“Abbas left his home for the first time when he was 14 years old, to feed and provide for us. He tagged along with his mastoto bhai (mother’s brother) who took him to a construction site in Kerala to learn the work. Since then he has been working as a construction worker in many southern states,” says Asmina Bibi, Abbasuddin’s mother.

Moving for money

The 2011 Census suggests that West Bengal recorded negative net migration for the first time. “Negative net migration indicates that more workers are migrating to other States in comparison to the number of migrants who move to West Bengal for temporary settlement, owing to the lack of work opportunities, falling returns from agriculture, and the drastic impact of climate change on their caste assigned work,” says Mr. Mistry. Upto .34 million people from migrated from the State to other States, for employment, with 0.22 from rural Bengal.

For most migrant labourers from the Sundarbans region in West Bengal, the decision to move to other States for work is less of a choice and more of a compulsion owing to the lack of development, work opportunities, and ecological challenges due to changing weather patterns.

One of those brought back home from Balasore was Nazimuddin Purkait, 37. He has been working in Kerala for the past two decades, and says migration for him was a question of survival. “The lands where we used to work as agricultural labourers are gradually getting submerged under the water,” he says, referring to the rising water level of the Bay of Bengal that is gradually eating away the mangroves and islands of the Sundarbans region. “Whenever a natural calamity hits and we lose these lands, the landowners get compensation, but what about us? What will my family eat? How will we survive here?” says Mr. Purkait.

Mr. Purkait went to Kerala with the help of his maternal uncle, who used to work there as a jewellery craftsman in a jewellery store that has a chain of shops. “Every passing year returns from the agricultural sector were successively lower than the previous year. Belonging to a family of fishermen and farm labourers, I realised that learning a skill will help me sustain all 12 months of the year,” says Mr. Purkait.

The jewellery craftsman comes back home to Kakdwip every five or six months. “Though the State government helped us to rehabilitate and build our houses, there are no job opportunities here. Had I stayed here or gone to Kolkata for the same work, I would have still been struggling to make ₹8,000 a month, but in Kerala, I can make ₹25,000 for the same number of hours, and get free housing and cheap food,” says Mr. Purkait.

Despite chances of linguistic familiarity in a metro city closer to their home, Kolkata remains very much an alien site for millions of migrant workers from Bengal’s districts. “Historically the industrial belt around Kolkata has recruited labour more from surrounding States than the far-away districts of the same State and it has contributed to this failure in building social networks and connections for these workers,” says Adil Hussain, assistant professor of political anthropology, at Azim Premji University, Bengaluru.

Away from home

Mr. Purkait is now petrified of boarding a train. The slightest noise or shaking triggers him. He talks about one instance, when at night the ceiling fan rattled a little. “I got up in a sweat,” he says, adding that even when the bed shakes, he is panicked. But he also knows he will have to board the train soon. Though perhaps only temporarily, mothers are nervous of sending their sons to work, because of the accident. “I myself am so scared of boarding a train, how do I convince them?” says Mr. Purkait.

A senior police official from the Sagar Island Coastal Police station, secure in a government job, says it is “greed” that has pushed people from the Sundarbans to work in other States, while Gram Sabha member, Abdus Rashid Sheikh says it is a choice between starvation and work stability for most landless people in the region. “Today, every second household in the district has a teenage son and adult men working outside West Bengal,” he says. Families often consist of parents, wives, and daughters. “There are villages where it is difficult to find an adult man to work for us or help during difficulties,” adds Mr. Sheikh.

Mr. Hussain says that while the social welfare schemes of the Mamata Banerjee government target women, and the enrolment and school completion rate of female students have increased, the dropout rate of male students in school has increased. “In the 90s when India’s economy India opened up, most would migrate to north Indian sites like Delhi, Gurgaon, and Ghaziabad, at present there is a rise in the domination of south Indian States for migration,” he says.

Survivor story

The other survivor from the village is Shanwar Hussain Mullah, 32, who returned with a head injury, an injured limb, and a blood-soaked fine parchi, issued to those travelling unreserved. The sole breadwinner of a family of five, he cannot fathom how he will put food on the table, educate his three minor sons, and get his late teenage daughter married.

“Despite belonging to a family of agricultural labourers, I started working as a construction worker seven years ago in states like Karnataka and Kerala,” he says. In Kerala, he felt there is less animosity towards Muslims. “In Karnataka, on many occasions I would get jibed at for being a Bangladeshi because I wear a lungi and speak Bengali. This has not come from employers, but mostly from local residents,” says Mr. Mullah.

Like the others, for Mr. Mullah too the Coromandel Express symbolised freedom from hunger and a promise of a better and stable income. “I could save around 60% of my daily earnings,” he said, adding that he would earn about ₹1,000 a day, against ₹300-400 in the Sundarbans. The company covered his lodging expenses.

While initially getting used to the coconut-oil-based cooking was difficult, Mr. Mullah says that in the past few years, quite a few pocket-friendly Bengali eateries and home delivery options had emerged around construction sites and labour chowks to meet the growing demand of Bengali labourers in the region.

The battered and bruised Mr. Mullah cannot think of returning and will only work in the Sundarbans in future. “The government should tell us how this accident happened,” he says. His wife, Anwara Bibi, stands quietly next to him, trying to offer him some relief with a hand fan."
