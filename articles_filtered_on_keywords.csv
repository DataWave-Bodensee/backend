0,0,Greek coast guard defends actions as more than 500 migrants heading for Europe feared dead in wreck - The Associated Press,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2dyZWVjZS1taXNzaW5nLW1pZ3JhbnRzLWthbGFtYXRhLThkOWU4Mjg0ZTI3ODgwNDY4ZDUyNGViOTM0YmIzZjJh0gEA?oc=5,"Fri, 16 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT","ATHENS, Greece (AP) — The Greek coast guard on Friday defended its response to a ship that went down off the country’s south coast and left more than 500 migrants presumed drowned. Criticism mounted over Europe’s yearslong failure to prevent such tragedies.

Patrol boats and a helicopter spent a third day scouring the area of the Mediterranean Sea where the packed fishing vessel capsized early Wednesday, in what the U.N. migration agency said could be the second deadliest migrant shipwreck recorded. The deadliest occurred when a vessel capsized off the coast of Libya en route to Italy in April 2015, killing an estimated 1,100 people.

Greek coast guard spokesman Nikos Alexiou said that both coast guard and private ships repeatedly offered by radio and loudspeaker to help the vessel Wednesday while it was in international waters, also heading from Libya to Italy, but they were rejected.

Alexiou argued that any effort to tow the overcrowded trawler or move hundreds of unwilling people onto nearby ships would have been too dangerous.

“Υou will have a disturbance, and the people will surge — which, unfortunately is what happened in the end,” Alexiou told state-run ERT TV. “You will have caused the accident.”

Alexiou also said that, after accepting food from a merchant ship, the trawler’s passengers rejected a rope bringing more from a second merchant ship “because they thought the whole process was a way for us to take them to Greece.”

Greek authorities sent the first ship, the tanker Lucky Sailor, to give the migrants food and water. The company managing the tanker said Friday that the people on board “were very hesitant to receive any assistance, and at any attempt of approach the boat started to maneuver away.”

Eastern Mediterranean Maritime Limited said in a statement that the people on the trawler were eventually persuaded to accept supplies.

Experts said maritime law obligated Greek authorities to attempt a rescue.

They definitely “had a duty to start rescue procedures” given the condition of the vessel, said Professor Erik Røsæg of the University of Oslo’s Institute of Private Law. He said a refusal of assistance can be overruled if deemed unreasonable, as it appeared to have been on Wednesday.

Flavio Di Giacomo of the Mediterranean office of the U.N. migration agency IOM tweeted that all migrant boats should be considered dangerous and rescued immediately because “even when they appear to have no problems, in a few minutes they can sink.”

Rescuers pulled 104 survivors from the water and later recovered 78 bodies but have not located any more since late Wednesday. The Greek coast guard said the search-and-rescue operation would continue beyond the standard 72 hours.

The U.N.'s migration and refugee agencies issued a joint statement calling timely maritime search and rescues “a legal and humanitarian imperative” and calling for “urgent and decisive action to prevent further deaths at sea.”

A group of nongovernmental organizations, including Amnesty International and Doctors Without Borders, said the EU should “stop seeing solutions solely in the dismantling” of smuggling networks, and set up state-led search-and-rescue operations in the Mediterranean..

“The Greek government had specific responsibilities toward every passenger on the vessel, which was clearly in distress,” Adriana Tidona of Amnesty International said. “This is a tragedy of unimaginable proportions, all the more so because it was entirely preventable.”

Greece and other southern EU nations that typically are the first destinations for Europe-bound asylum-seekers traveling by sea have toughened border protection measures in recent years, extending walls and intensifying maritime patrols.

“This is a European problem. I think it’s time for Europe to be able, in solidarity, to define an effective migration policy for these kinds of situations not to happen again,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said during a news conference at U.N. headquarters in New York late Thursday.

The EU’s executive commission says the 27-nation bloc is close to an agreement on how member countries can share responsibility in caring for migrants and refugees who undertake the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean.

A judicial investigation is also underway into the causes of the sinking. Greek officials say the vessel capsized minutes after it lost power, speculating that panic among the passengers may have caused the boat to list and roll over.

Most of the survivors were being moved Friday from a storage hangar at the southern port of Kalamata, where relatives also gathered to look for loved ones, to migrant shelters near Athens.

Abdo Sheikhi, a Kurdish Syrian living in Germany, traveled to Kalamata to find out what happened to five family members who were on the boat.

On Friday, he discovered that only his younger brother Ali and another relative had survived. He managed to speak on the phone to Ali, who has been moved to the camp near Athens.

“(Ali) told me he jumped (off the) ship while the others could not jump,” Sheikhi said. “They were scared. They were holding on to the boat as it swayed.”

Nine people — all men from Egypt, ranging in age from 20 to 40 — were arrested and detained and charged Friday of people smuggling and participating in a criminal enterprise. Twenty-seven of the survivors remain hospitalized, health officials said. The smuggling suspects are due to appear in court Monday.

The IOM has estimated the boat carried as many as 750 people, and U.N. human rights office spokesman Jeremy Laurence said the missing included “large numbers of women and children.”

The survivors were all boys and men from Egypt, Pakistan, Syria and the Palestinian territories. Alexiou, citing survivor accounts, said passengers in the hold of the fishing boat included women and children but that the number of missing, believed to be in the hundreds, still remained unclear.

Officials at a state-run morgue outside Athens photographed the faces of the victims and gathered DNA samples to start the identification process.

Late Friday, Greece’s coast guard said a navy helicopter located a sailboat with migrants off southwestern Greece after being alerted by Italian authorities. It said three merchant ships had reached the vessel, which reported no trouble and was heading for Italy. ERT TV said about 60 people were believed to be on board.

2,2,The Migrant Shipwreck Near Greece Is a Horrible Tragedy. But It Wasn't an Accident. - Jacobin magazine,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi9zaGlwd3JlY2stZ3JlZWNlLW1pZ3JhdGlvbi1jb2FzdC1ndWFyZC1wdXNoYmFja3MtcmVndWxhdGlvbi1hc3lsdW0tc2Vla2Vyc9IBAA?oc=5,"Wed, 21 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT","Early last Wednesday, a fishing boat sank off the coast of Pílos, Greece. The vessel was overpacked with people trying to reach Europe — reports say there were up to 750 people on board. Greek authorities have stated that the coast guard rescued 104 survivors and that 78 people are confirmed to have died. Around 560 are still missing. Days after the wreck it is clear that these hundreds of people likely drowned. EU officials have deemed this “the worst ever tragedy” in the Mediterranean. But this shipwreck is not an aberration or an inevitable accident. It is the direct result of Greek and EU practices and regulations that have made entering Europe and seeking asylum increasingly impossible, forcing people to take more and more dangerous routes. It is the product of years of political decisions that have turned the Mediterranean into a graveyard.

The Shipwreck According to Greek state broadcaster ERT, the fishing trawler set out from Tobruk, Libya, directly south of Crete. Authorities said most of those onboard were from Egypt, Pakistan, Syria, and Palestine. Alarm Phone — an NGO that supports sea rescues and communicates with people traveling on such ships — has stated that it was first contacted by people on board the ship early on Tuesday afternoon. Throughout the afternoon and into the early evening, Alarm Phone received various distress calls from those on board — saying that it was overcrowded, that by 5 p.m. the boat was not moving, that the captain had abandoned them, and that the boat was shuttering from side to side. They communicated these distress calls to the relevant authorities, including the Greek coast guard. They were unable to maintain consistent contact with the boat and had their last contact shortly before 1 a.m. last Wednesday. The Greek coast guard’s conflicting account states that the vessel was first spotted by Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, at midday on Tuesday, June 13. It claims that once it achieved contact, those on board repeatedly stated that “the boat was not in danger, they wanted no help other than food and water, and that they wished to continue on to Italy.” The coast guard states that at 1:40 a.m., the boat ceased moving, and at 2:04 a.m., a coast guard floating vessel reported that the trawler had capsized. International legal experts have noted that even if those on board the trawler said they did not want to be rescued, the coast guard had the obligation to independently evaluate if it was seaworthy and intervene if it was not. Photos of the trawler show that it was clearly overpacked, those on board did not appear to be wearing life vests, and the vessel was not flying any flag. Moreover, evidence from the Greek investigative outlet Solomon proves that the authorities had been notified that the ship was in distress by 6 p.m. Video and animated tracking data verified by the BBC shows that the boat was not moving for at least seven hours before it capsized. The Greek state has, however, chosen to blame others — supposed smugglers. In the days following the tragedy, it arrested nine men, said to be from Egypt, and charged them with forming a criminal organization for the purpose of illegal migrant trafficking, causing a shipwreck, and endangering human life. They will give their full testimonies in the town of Kalamata on Tuesday, June 20. According to ERT, eight of the accused have said they were simply passengers. Meanwhile the prosecutor of Greece’s supreme court has ordered an investigation into the shipwreck. For years, the Greek government has focused on the criminalization of smuggling — offering this as a solution to deaths along the borders and at sea. “We have to eradicate all the smuggling rings, the NGOs, anyone who exploits and makes €5 million to bring a boat to Greece. Five million was the income of whoever owned the boat!” said Greece’s former minister of migration in the days after the tragedy. The scourge of smugglers is something he and other officials speak about often and a focus of court cases brought on the Greek Aegean islands. Those accused of steering rickety boats across the border are frequently prosecuted for smuggling and hit with decades-long prison sentences. In reality, often these are people who were themselves hoping to reach Europe and were left at sea with a rudder in hand. This focus on smugglers ignores the larger context that has led people to follow traffickers and pay thousands of euros for this deadly route. “While an investigation is urgently needed to clarify the circumstances of the incident, this tragedy is the latest in a long chain of shipwrecks in Greece and across Europe that were entirely preventable,” commented Adriana Tidona, Amnesty International’s researcher on migration. “Today, families are mourning loved ones, and more are searching for those they cannot reach. European politicians could have prevented this from happening by establishing safe and legal routes for people to arrive in Europe. These are the only way to avoid such frequently occurring tragedies.”",True,"['Death', 'Migrant', 'Missing', 'Asylum', 'Accident', 'Boat', 'Rescue']"

More than 300 Pakistani nationals have been killed in the sinking of a overcrowded fishing trawler off the coast of Greece, the latest tragedy to expose the refugee crisis confronting the European Union as tens of thousands seek sanctuary from war, persecution and poverty.

The chairman of of Pakistan’s Senate, Muhammad Sadiq Sanjrani, disclosed the numbers in a statement Sunday, sending condolences to grieving families of the dead.

“Our thoughts and prayers are with you, and we pray that the departed souls find eternal peace,” Sanjrani said. “This devastating incident underscores the urgent need to address and condemn the abhorrent act of illegal human trafficking.”

Greek authorities have yet to confirm Pakistan’s death toll.

Pakistan is in the midst of its worst economic crisis in decades, with efforts to secure a financial lifeline from the International Monetary Fund complicated by political turmoil in the country.

Growth has stalled and inflation has soared in the South Asian country of 220 million over the past year. The country has struggled to import essential food products, leading to deadly stampedes at distribution centers.

The number of Pakistanis traversing dangerous routes to Europe in search of a better future has reverberated through the nation, prompting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to declare Monday a national day of mourning for those who died in the boat’s sinking.

In a tweet Sunday, he ordered a “high-level inquiry” into the incident.

“I assure the nation that those found negligent towards their duty will be held to account. Responsibility will be fixed after the inquiry and heads will roll,” Sharif wrote.

The boat capsized off the Greek coast last week while traveling from Libya to Italy. Greece Coast Guard

About 750 men, women and children were on the packed boat when it capsized last week, the United Nations Migration Agency (IOM) said, killing hundreds and making the tragedy one of the worst in the Mediterranean Sea, according to the EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson.

Every year, tens of thousands of migrants fleeing war, persecution, climate change and poverty risk treacherous routes to Europe.

Johansson condemned the role of “smugglers” who put people on the boats.

“They are not sending them to Europe, they are sending them to death. This is what they’re doing and it’s absolutely necessary to prevent it,” she said.

Questions raised

Greek authorities have faced criticism for how the disaster was handled, and uncomfortable questions have been raised about European countries’ attitudes toward migrants.

Despite the dangers, tens of thousands of people are willing to risk everything to make the unsafe journey to Europe, searching for a better life.

At the same time, many European countries have toughened their borders and their stance toward migrants.

Last week, Greek authorities denied claims that the boat had capsized after the coast guard attempted to tow it to shore.

Authorities had initially said the coast guard kept its distance but their assistance “had been declined” after they threw a rope to the vessel to “stabilize and check if it needed help.”

But Tarek Aldroobi, a man who had three relatives on board, told CNN that they had seen Greek authorities towing the vessel with ropes – but says they were tied in the “wrong places,” which caused it to capsize.

“Their boat was in a good condition and the Greek navy tried towing them to the beach but the ropes were tied in the wrong places,” Aldroobi said. “When the Greek navy tried pulling them it caused the boat to capsize.”

Speaking to Greek national broadcaster ERT, government spokesperson Ilias Siakanderis said the coast guard arrived two hours before the boat capsized after its engine broke down and there had been “no connection” between the two.

“The engine broke down at 1:40 a.m. and at 2:00 a.m. it sank – therefore there can be no connection between (the coast guard approaching the boat and the time of its sinking),” he told ERT.

The Hellenic coast guard also defended its response.

“When the boat capsized, we were not even next to boat. How could we be towing it?” Nikos Alexiou, a spokesman for the coast guard told CNN.

Alexiou said their patrol boat only used a small rope to stabilize itself while it was close to the migrant boat hours before it sank, and the patrol boat would have been unable to tow the fishing boat.

“Regretfully there was movement of people, a shift in weight probably caused by panic and the boat capsized. As soon as we got there, we started our rescue operation to collect those who were in the water,” said Alexiou.",True,"['Refugee', 'Death', 'Migrant', 'Boat', 'Rescue']"
4,4,US charges driver in fatal crash near Texas migrant shelter - Al Jazeera English,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzUvOC91cy1jaGFyZ2VzLWRyaXZlci1pbi1mYXRhbC1jcmFzaC1uZWFyLXRleGFzLW1pZ3JhbnQtc2hlbHRlctIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvMjAyMy81LzgvdXMtY2hhcmdlcy1kcml2ZXItaW4tZmF0YWwtY3Jhc2gtbmVhci10ZXhhcy1taWdyYW50LXNoZWx0ZXI?oc=5,"Mon, 08 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT","Police chief in the border town of Brownsville, Texas says officials have not ruled out whether the crash was intentional.

Authorities in the United States have charged a man with eight counts of manslaughter after he rammed his vehicle into a group of people standing outside a migrant shelter in Brownsville, Texas, near the border with Mexico.

During a news conference on Monday, Brownsville Police Chief Felix Sauceda told reporters that the suspect, identified as George Alvarez, attempted to flee the scene after hitting 18 people with a sport utility vehicle (SUV) on Sunday morning.

At least eight people were killed in the incident, which Sauceda described as “a tragic event”.

“Through the investigation, it was found that the SUV ran a red light, lost control, flipped on its side and struck a total of 18 individuals,” said Sauceda, who added that authorities have not ruled out the possibility that the crash was intentional.

The incident comes amid months of heated rhetoric around immigration and just days before a border restriction known as Title 42 is set to expire, prompting concerns around a possible influx of migrants and refugees at the US-Mexico border.

Sauceda said on Monday that several of the victims were originally from Venezuela, adding that US authorities were communicating with Venezuelan government officials about the incident. He confirmed that all the victims standing outside the shelter, called the Ozanam Center, were men.

“We grieve for the victims in Brownsville, Texas who were run over outside a migrant shelter where people from around the world are seeking asylum and safety,” said Oni Blair, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Texas.

Horrific. We grieve for the victims and for our Brownsville community. We call on federal, state, and local governments to take immediate action to protect migrants and ensure witnesses can come forward without fear of deportation or reprisals. https://t.co/ifZVCcPIih — ACLU of Texas (@ACLUTx) May 7, 2023

“We understand the motive is still under investigation,” Blair said in a statement on Sunday. She urged authorities to ensure that witnesses to Sunday’s incident can come forward without fear of retribution or deportation.

“This horrific event comes after weeks of escalating anti-immigrant policy-making by Texas politicians and while the Biden administration considers imposing a new asylum ban aimed at deterring, rather than welcoming, migrants seeking protection.”

A video online purporting to capture the crash shows a speeding SUV ploughing into a row of people sitting on the side of a road. A second video appears to show the aftermath, with victims lying on the ground, some bloodied and writhing, others motionless.

Shelter director Victor Maldonado said the SUV ran up the curb, flipped and continued moving for about 60m (200 feet). Some people walking on the sidewalk about 9m (30 feet) from the main group were also hit, Maldonado said.

Maldonado said the centre had not received any threats before the crash, but it did afterwards. “I’ve had a couple of people come by the gate and tell the security guard that the reason this happened was because of us,” he said.

Luis Herrera, a witness whose arm was hurt in the incident, told the AFP news agency that the crash was “sudden”.

“A woman went by in a car and warned us to get out of the way,” the 36-year-old Venezuelan national said. “It was a matter of moments. The killer came [through] in the car, gesturing at us, insulting us.”

Sauceda, the police chief, said on Monday that the suspect — who faces 10 counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, among other charges — had an extensive criminal history and was being held on $3.6m bail. Alvarez made a brief appearance in court on Monday,

“I think the community as a whole is in mourning for the loss of the souls,” said Cameron County Judge Eddie Treviño.

“It’s a terrible tragic event. And regardless, whether it was intentional or accidental, it doesn’t matter. Those now eight individuals that lost their lives and the other 10 that are hospitalized, we’re praying for them and for their families.”

Brownsville is one of several US border towns expecting an increase in asylum seeker arrivals when Title 42 expires on Thursday.

The policy, which has been slammed by rights groups since it was first invoked in March 2020, allowed US border officials to rapidly turn away most people seeking protection at the border.

The surge in the number of asylum seekers this past week has prompted Brownsville commissioners to indefinitely extend an emergency declaration during a special meeting last Thursday.

“We don’t want them wandering around outside,” Pedro Cardenas, a city commissioner, said of the asylum seekers on Sunday after the crash. “So we’re trying to make sure they’re as comfortable as they can be so they don’t have to go out and look for anywhere else.”

A vigil will be held at the Texas State Capitol in Austin on Monday evening “to honor the memory of the lives lost in Brownsville and demand an end to policies that dehumanize immigrants”.

Rochelle Garza, president of the Texas Civil Rights Project, an advocacy group, said in a statement on Sunday: “I hope that today serves as a wake up call and that state officials will begin investing in a humanitarian response that might have helped the people who were impacted by this morning’s tragedy.”

Kassem Abozeed had arrived in Kalamata to try to find his wife and brother-in-law, as relatives poured into the Greek port city on Thursday, searching for their loved ones missing after a migrant boat sank off the coast, killing dozens of people.

The 34-year-old refugee fled from the Syrian civil war to Hamburg, Germany, in 2016. He told reporters that his 21-year-old partner, Ezma, and her 19-year-old sibling, Abdullah, were two of the passengers caught up in one of the largest-scale migrant vessel disasters in southern Europe this year.

“I tried to get my wife to come to Germany but it was very difficult to do so in a legal way. So we tried through Libya,” Abozeed said.

“The last time we spoke was eight days ago and she told me she was ready to get on the boat. She paid $5,000.”

He reflected on his relationship with his wife. “It was a love story.”

Family members gathering at the port in southern Greece, as hopes for survivors fade and the scale of the tragedy starts to sink in.

At least 78 people died after the vessel went down on Wednesday, with campaigners warning there could have been hundreds more on board, meaning the death toll could rise.

A total of 104 passengers were rescued and sent to Kalamata, as emergency workers struggled to contain the fallout.

Authorities warned the likelihood of finding survivors was waning, because the boat sank in “very deep” waters.

“A sudden shift in weight is likely to be the cause of what led the boat to capsize and then sink,” Hellenic Coast Guard spokesman Nikos Alexiou told CNN on Thursday.

“As the incident took place at very deep waters it is not clear how operations will continue beyond the current stage.”

Rescuers were likely to wind down their search for survivors soon, according to Thanasis Vasilopoulos, the mayor of Kalamata. “It’s hard to see search and rescue operations going on for much longer,” he said. “Unfortunately, we have not found any survivors today. The waters in the area where the incident happened are very deep. It is hard to imagine finding survivors by now.”

The people rescued – all of whom are men – include 43 Egyptian nationals, 47 Syrian nationals, 12 Pakistani nationals, and two Palestinians, the Hellenic Coast Guard said. Eight of those rescued were minors.

There were an estimated 750 passengers on the ship, including at least 40 children, according to a spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration.

“If these numbers were confirmed, it would be the second most serious shipwreck in the Mediterranean,” Flavio Di Giacomo tweeted.

The Mediterranean region near Greece is a key route for migrants and refugees attempting to flee political strife in the Middle East, Asia and Africa.

The number of undocumented people arriving on European shores has soared this year due to conflict, global inequality and the climate crisis, exacerbating a migrant crisis across the continent.

More than 36,000 people arrived in the Mediterranean from January to March this year, nearly twice the number compared with the same period in 2022, according to figures from the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR).

The capsized ship had set off from the port city of Tobruk, in Libya, state broadcaster ERT reported. It was traveling to Italy, Greek officials said.

Poor communication lines marred initial efforts to contact the boat, which received water from a merchant vessel on Tuesday evening local time after the first distress call.

‘State of anxiety’

Emergency volunteers described frantic scenes on Thursday, as they tried to comfort traumatized survivors sheltering in a makeshift warehouse in Kalamata.

Hypocrates Efstathiou, a social worker for the Greek NGO IASIS, said the mental state of those rescued was “intense.”

“They are in great need of support. People are still in shock. They have been describing their attempts to survive. And they are asking for relatives. From their accounts there seem to have been women and children on board,” he told CNN while helping survivors on the ground.

Dimitris Chaliotis, a volunteer for the Hellenic Red Cross said he had “never seen a rescue operation like this one before. It is a tragedy,” according to a statement from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

Another rescue volunteer, Maria Triantou, said many of the survivors were in “a state of anxiety,” following the incident.

“These people had not eaten for many days, had not drunk water for many days, were burnt by the sun,” the Greek Rescue Team member told CNN affiliate CNN Greece.

Triantou told CNN the men were “dehydrated and had some breathing problems, but things [are] now normalizing.”

Once the survivors started recovering, fear and panic kicked in, she added. “Now they want to know what happened to others, including family members.”

CNN saw several people arriving at the port looking for relatives.

One man who said he was Egyptian but refused to speak to press briefly explained he had come to look for his cousin. He was nervously peering behind the fenced area of the port warehouse, where survivors are temporarily resting.

They are expected to be transferred to a larger facility in greater Athens, local authorities said.

‘Failure of the international community’

Humanitarian bodies said the boat disaster was a damning indictment on the inability of EU countries to create “safe pathways to protection” for refugees.

IFRC operations manager Frido Herinckx stressed how “heart-wrenching and simply unacceptable that these people, who were seeking safety and a better future, have died at the EU borders in 2023.”

The first quarter of 2023 was already “the deadliest on record on the Central Mediterranean route and this tragedy could be one of the worst ever as the search for the missing continues,” Herinckx said.

“Every one of the lives lost should be on our collective conscience due to the failure to provide safe pathways to protection.”

IFRC President Francesco Rocca described the shipwreck as an “the icon of the failure of the international community.”

“It is shocking and unacceptable that people are still dying in front of EU borders, seeking a safe place,” Rocca tweeted Thursday.",True,"['Refugee', 'Death', 'Migrant', 'Missing', 'Boat', 'Rescue']"
9,11,Hope dims for missing migrants amid questions about Greece's actions in deadly sinking - The Associated Press,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2dyZWVjZS1pdGFseS1saWJ5YS1taWdyYXRpb24tc2hpcC1zaW5raW5nLWMzOGNiODNmN2I4NWMyOWIwNTE2YWVhMjUwOWI1ODc40gEA?oc=5,"Wed, 14 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT","KALAMATA, Greece (AP) — Nine survivors from a migrant boat that sank were arrested Thursday on suspicion of smuggling as hope faded for hundreds of missing passengers and attention turned to Greece’s failure to act before the overcrowded ship capsized.

The trawler may have carried as many as 750 passengers, including women and children who were likely trapped in the hold as the vessel overturned and went down early Wednesday. That could make the sinking one of the deadliest ever in the central Mediterranean Sea.

A huge search-and-rescue operation initially recovered 78 bodies and picked up 104 survivors — all men and boys. But no more have been found.

Meanwhile, Greek authorities were criticized for not acting to rescue the migrants, even though a coast guard vessel escorted the trawler for hours and watched helplessly as it sank in minutes. Greek officials argued that the migrants repeatedly refused assistance and insisted on continuing to Italy. Legal experts said that was no excuse.

The coast guard said late Thursday that it had arrested nine survivors on suspicion of belonging to the smuggling ring that arranged the voyage. State-run ERT TV said the suspects were all Egyptians, adding that the ship originally left an Egyptian port for the area of Tobruk in eastern Libya, where it picked up the migrants.

Relatives of the migrants — who each paid thousands of dollars for passage on the battered vessel — gathered in the southern port city of Kalamata to look for their loved ones.

Kassem Abu Zeed said he caught the first flight from Germany to Greece after realizing that his wife and brother-in-law were aboard the trawler.

“The last time we spoke was eight days ago, and (my wife) told me that she was getting ready to get on the boat,” Abu Zeed told The Associated Press. “She had paid $5,000” to smugglers. “And then we all know what happened.”

Abu Zeed, a 34-year-old Syrian refugee living in Hamburg, said Esra Aoun, 21, and her 19-year-old brother, Abdullah, risked the dangerous crossing from Libya to Italy after they failed to find a legal way to join him in Germany.

The chances are low that Abu Zeed’s wife survived the sinking about 75 kilometers (45 miles) offshore. None of those rescued were women.

Now he hopes Abdullah may be among the men from Syria, Egypt, Pakistan and the Palestinian territories who are being temporarily housed in a Kalamata warehouse or recuperating in hospitals from hypothermia and exposure.

The chances of finding more survivors “are minimal,” retired Greek coast guard Adm. Nikos Spanos told ERT.

The U.N. migration agency, known as IOM, estimated the number of passengers based on interviews with survivors and said the complement included at least 40 children.

Erasmia Roumana, head of a United Nations refugee agency delegation, said many of the survivors have friends and relatives unaccounted for.

“They want to get in touch with their families to tell them they are OK, and they keep asking about the missing,” Roumana said.

Mohamed Abdi Marwan, who spoke by phone from Kobani, a Kurdish majority town in Syria, said five of his relatives were on the boat, including a 14-year-old. Marwan said he’s heard nothing about them since the vessel sank.

He believes his nephew Ali Sheikhi, 29, is alive, after family members spotted him in photos of survivors, but that has not been confirmed.

“Those smugglers were supposed to only have 500 on the boat and now we hear there were 750. What is this? Are they cattle or humans? How can they do this?” Marwan said. He said each of his relatives paid $6,000 for the trip.

Greek authorities said the vessel appeared to be sailing normally until shortly before it sank and refused repeated rescue offers. But a network of activists said they received repeated distress calls from the vessel during the same time.

The Greek coast guard said it was notified of the boat’s presence late Tuesday morning and observed by helicopter that it was “sailing on a steady course” at 6 p.m.

A little later, Greek search-and-rescue officials reached someone on the boat by satellite phone, who repeatedly said that passengers needed food and water but wanted to continue to Italy.

Merchant ships delivered supplies and observed the vessel until early Wednesday morning, when the satellite phone user reported a problem with the engine. About 40 minutes later, according to the coast guard statement, the migrant vessel began to rock violently and sank.

Coast guard experts believe the boat may have run out of fuel or experienced engine trouble, with movement of passengers causing it to list and capsize.

Alarm Phone, a network of activists that provides a hotline for migrants in trouble, said the problems began much earlier in the day. The network said it was contacted by people on the vessel seeking help shortly after 3 p.m. They said they “cannot survive the night.”

Around 6:20 p.m., Alarm Phone wrote, migrants reported the vessel was not moving and that the captain had left on a small boat. The two accounts could not immediately be reconciled.

Experts said maritime law would have required Greek authorities to attempt a rescue if the boat was unsafe, regardless of whether passengers requested it.

Search and rescue “is not a two-way contract. You don’t need consent,” retired Italian coast guard Adm. Vittorio Alessandro said.

An aerial photograph of the vessel before it sank released by Greek authorities showed people crammed on the deck. Most were not wearing life jackets.

Overcrowding, a lack of life vests, or the absence of a captain would have all been reasons to intervene, Alessandro said.

Professor Erik Røsæg from the University of Oslo’s Institute of Private Law said Greek authorities definitely “had a duty to start rescue procedures” given the condition of the trawler.

He said a captain’s refusal of assistance can be overruled if deemed unreasonable. “It appears that the refusal in this case was highly unreasonable,” Røsæg said.

Greece’s caretaker minister for civil protection, Evangelos Tournas, defended the coast guard’s conduct, saying it couldn’t intervene with an unwilling vessel in international waters.

“Consider also that an intervention by the coast guard could have placed an overloaded vessel in danger, which could capsize as a result,” he said.

The trawler sank near the deepest part of the Mediterranean, where depths of up to 17,000 feet (5,200 meters) could hamper any effort to locate a sunken vessel.

Human rights groups say a European Union crackdown on smuggling has forced people to take longer, more dangerous routes to reach safe countries.

Eftychia Georgiadi, an official in Greece with the International Rescue Committee charity, said the EU’s failure to offer more safe pathways to migration “effectively slams the door on people seeking protection.”

“Nobody embarks on these treacherous journeys unless they feel they have no other option,” she said.

At least 15 people have drowned after a boat carrying migrants and refugees capsized off the coast of the capital Dakar, according to Senegal’s President Macky Sall, in the latest tragedy involving desperate people undertaking perilous sea journey to reach Europe.

“I express my deep sorrow following the death of around fifteen Senegalese people following the sinking of a pirogue [a long wooden boat] off the coast of Dakar. My heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of the victims,” Sall said on his Twitter account.

The bodies were discovered by the navy early on Monday morning and are believed to be migrants because of the type of boat they were in, said Ndeye Top Gueye, the deputy mayor of the Ouakam neighbourhood of Dakar where the bodies were found.

“Because of the size and shape, we know that it’s a pirogue,” she said.

While this is the first time bodies have washed up in the neighbourhood, migrant deaths at sea are becoming more common in Senegal, she said.

“It’s not the first time, it’s the umpteenth time. The government needs to take countermeasures.”

Babacar Diallo, an Ouakam fisherman who went down to the beach at dawn to prepare boats for the day’s catch, said he saw people trying to help with rescue efforts.

“There were at least 12 dead bodies on the shore. Two people came out alive,” Diallo said. Bodies were also being brought ashore hours later.

“They are still retrieving bodies, but the water is not clear. We indicated to them where they could find them. We live here, and in case of danger, we can tell them where to find the bodies. There are probably still more bodies,” Diallo added.

A contingent of firefighters and divers were still searching for bodies in the area on Monday afternoon.

Senegal has seen a surge in migrant boats attempting the Atlantic migration route to Spain’s Canary Islands. Although it is one of the deadliest routes, numerous accidents have failed to dissuade those seeking to make the journey.

Senegal’s navy said on July 13 that it had intercepted a boat with around 70 migrants risking the perilous journey, the third reported crossing this month as attempted crossings from West Africa pick up in the warmer summer months.

At the beach where the bodies were found, reporters saw rescuers and volunteers working together to pull the capsized boat ashore. Clothes from the deceased washed onto the side and lay in a pile while authorities coordinated a response.

Thousands of people from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region take the perilous sea route to reach Europe, often aboard dinghy boats. Last year, nearly 3,800 people died, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

The United Nations has recorded more than 20,000 deaths and disappearances in the central Mediterranean since 2014, making it the most dangerous migrant crossing in the world.",True,"['Refugee', 'Death', 'Migrant', 'Crossing', 'Accident', 'Boat', 'Rescue']"
11,14,Greek migrant boat wreck may be Mediterranean’s ‘worst ever tragedy’ with hundreds still missing - CNN,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8xNy93b3JsZC9ncmVlY2UtYm9hdC13b3JzdC1ldmVyLXRyYWdlZHktbWVkaXRlcnJhbmVhbi1zZWEtaW50bC1obmsvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBYmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjMvMDYvMTcvd29ybGQvZ3JlZWNlLWJvYXQtd29yc3QtZXZlci10cmFnZWR5LW1lZGl0ZXJyYW5lYW4tc2VhLWludGwtaG5r?oc=5,"Sat, 17 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT","CNN —

The sinking of a packed migrant boat off the coast of Greece may be “the worst tragedy ever” in the Mediterranean sea, according to the EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson.

Dozens of people were killed and hundreds more left missing when the boat, traveling from the coastal city of Tobruk in Libya to Italy, capsized off the coast of Greece earlier this week. The true toll of the disaster is yet to become clear.

“We don’t have all information yet on what has happened but it seems like this is the worst ever tragedy we’ve seen in the Mediterranean,” she told a press conference in Brussels on Friday.

The tragedy has shone a spotlight on the EU refugee crisis in which every year, tens of thousands of migrants fleeing war, persecution, climate change and poverty risk treacherous routes to Europe.

Johansson condemned the role of “smugglers” who put people on the boats. “They are not sending them to Europe, they are sending them to death. This is what they’re doing and it’s absolutely necessary to prevent it,” she said.

“Unfortunately, we have seen this coming because since the start of the year, there was a new modus operandi with these fishing boats leaving from the eastern part of Libya… and we’ve seen an increase of 600% of these departures this year,” she added, stressing the need to find “different ways to fight the smugglers and save lives.”

“When it comes to fighting the smugglers, we can’t rely on only one way to do that. We have to use intelligence – we have to use common police investigations together with countries of origin, with countries of transit, with countries of departure,” she said.

Other global bodies such as the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) called for “urgent and decisive action” to prevent further deaths in the Mediterranean and emphasized “the duty to rescue people in distress at sea without delay.”

Denial from authorities

Greek authorities have faced criticism for how the disaster was handled.

On Friday, they denied claims that the boat had capsized after the coast guard attempted to tow it to shore.

Authorities had initially said the coast guard kept its distance but their assistance “had been declined” after they threw a rope to the vessel to “stabilize and check if it needed help.”

Tarek Aldroobi, who had three relatives on board, told CNN that they had seen Greek authorities towing the vessel with ropes, but says they were tied in the “wrong places” – which caused it to capsize.

“Their boat was in a good condition and the Greek navy tried towing them to the beach but the ropes were tied in the wrong places,” Aldroobi said. “When the Greek navy tried pulling them it caused the boat to capsize.”

Speaking to Greek national broadcaster ERT, government spokesperson Ilias Siakanderis said the coast guard arrived two hours before the boat capsized after its engine broke down and there had been “no connection” between the two.

“The engine broke down at 1:40 a.m. and at 2:00 a.m. it sank – therefore there can be no connection between (the coast guard approaching the boat and the time of its sinking),” he told ERT.

The Hellenic coast guard also defended its response.

“When the boat capsized, we were not even next to boat. How could we be towing it?” Nikos Alexiou, a spokesman for the coast guard told CNN.

Alexiou said their patrol boat only used a small rope to stabilize itself while it was close to the migrant boat hours earlier when they approached to check its condition, but they were not equipped to tow it.

“Let’s not mix up the big boats, specialized rescue boats, that have specialized ropes to tow boats. Our patrol boat could not tow the fishing boat,” he said.

According to Alexiou the coast guard had been observing the boat at close but not mooring distance, when they started approaching following an alert that the migrant boat’s engine had failed.

“Regretfully there was movement of people, a shift in weight probably caused by panic and the boat capsized. As soon as we got there, we started our rescue operation to collect those who were in the water,” he explained.

The NGO Alarm Phone meanwhile alleged that the coast guard was aware that the boat was in distress hours before it capsized.

The coast guard this week said it had repeatedly asked the boat if it needed assistance and were told it did not. Authorities also previously said they could not intervene with the boat without being asked for assistance, as the boat was in international waters.",True,"['Refugee', 'Death', 'Migrant', 'Missing', 'Boat', 'Rescue']"

At least 15 people were killed when a crowded bus carrying primarily Venezuelan migrants and asylum seekers collided with a trailer on a highway in Mexico on Tuesday.

The crash is the latest tragedy to unfold on the country’s highways, where road conditions can be perilous and organised crime can hold sway over certain routes.

Tuesday’s collision occurred on a highway connecting the states of Puebla and Oaxaca, a route known to be used by migrant smugglers. At least 36 others were injured, according to the Puebla government.

The identities of those killed — and whether they were all from Venezuela — were not immediately clear in the wake of the incident, though government sources indicated that most of the passengers were from that country.

Oaxaca Governor Salomon Jara Cruz said he had instructed authorities to provide support to the injured.

“We send a hug and our condolences to the families of the deceased,” he wrote on social media.

The bus driver’s identity has yet to be released, and it was not immediately known who orchestrated the journey.

Road accidents and unsafe transport have become a leading cause of death for migrants and asylum seekers attempting to travel from Mexico’s southern border to the United States. Smugglers often use unsafe vehicles, packed to the brim with travellers.

Tuesday’s deadly collision comes just weeks after 18 people were killed on August 3, when a bus carrying migrants plummeted into a ravine in the northwestern state of Nayarit.

In July, another bus — this time in Oaxaca — plunged off a steep road, killing as many as 27 people. Another 18 people were killed in a crash in April. And in February, migrants from Venezuela, Colombia, and Central America were involved in a bus crash between Oaxaca and Puebla that left at least 17 dead.

One of the deadliest incidents in recent years came in December 2021, when a trailer carrying 160 migrants crashed into a pedestrian bridge in the southern state of Chiapas. That collision left 56 people — mostly Guatemalan citizens — dead.

Crashes are just one of the many perils migrants and asylum seekers face as they journey north to the US-Mexico border, a common destination. Many must also confront dangerous jungle passages, criminal gangs, and the risk of extended detention.

In late July, Panama’s government reported that, since January, a record number of people had crossed the Darien Gap, an inhospitable stretch of jungle connecting Central and Southern America. More than 248,901 had travelled through the route, many of them children.

More than 100,000 were from Venezuela, which has seen a massive exodus amid a humanitarian crisis and years of economic turmoil. The COVID-19 pandemic, government reforms and Western sanctions against the government of President Nicolas Maduro have contributed to the country’s economic slowdown.",True,"['Death', 'Migrant', 'Asylum', 'Seeker', 'Accident']"

At least 78 people have died and many more are feared missing after a fishing boat carrying refugees and migrants capsized and sank off the southern coast of Greece – one of the worst such disasters this year.

The Greek coastguard said in a statement on Wednesday the vessel sank in international waters, 47 nautical miles (87km) southwest of Pylos, off the Peloponnese coast. The spot is close to one of the deepest areas of the Mediterranean.

Rescuers saved 104 passengers – including Egyptians, Syrians, Pakistanis, Afghans and Palestinians – and recovered 79 bodies.

The search continued early on Thursday for more survivors, with aircraft dropping flares to help search teams.

“It’s one of the biggest [such] operations ever in the Mediterranean,” Greek coastguard spokesman Nikos Alexiou told state ERT TV.

“We won’t stop looking,” he said.

The sinking could be one of the worst ever recorded on the feared central Mediterranean migration route, which is the world’s deadliest.

Ioannis Zafiropoulos, deputy mayor of the southern port city of Kalamata, where survivors were taken, said his information indicated there were “more than 500 people” on board.

Six coastguard vessels, a navy frigate, a military transport and an air force helicopter, as well as several private vessels, were taking part in the search for those missing overnight.

An aerial photograph of the battered blue vessel released by the coastguard showed a large number of people covering practically every inch of deck.

Coastguard spokesman Alexiou told state ERT TV it appeared that the 25- to 30-metre (80- to 100-foot) vessel capsized after people abruptly moved to one side.

“The outer deck was full of people, and we presume the interior [of the vessel] would also have been full,” he said. “It looks as if there was a shift among the people who were crammed on board, and it capsized.”

Greek authorities cannot confirm reports the boat had an estimated 700-750 people on board, the spokesman for Greece’s caretaker government, Ilias Siakantaris, told ERT.

“We do not know what was in the hold … but we know that several smugglers lock people up to maintain control,” said Siakantaris.

‘Side effect of EU policies’

Eleni Spathana, a lawyer working with the Greek NGO Refugee Support Aegean, told Al Jazeera there were “no words” to describe the latest tragedy.

“Our reaction is of shock, of course,” said Spathana, stressing the repeated sea disasters were a byproduct of the European Union’s migration policies.

“[They are] a side effect of the deterrent EU policies and all these efforts – no matter what – to keep people in need of protection and support outside the EU territory.”

Four of the survivors were hospitalised in the port city of Kalamata with symptoms of hypothermia. Dozens of others were taken to sheltered areas in the city that were set up by the ambulance services and the United Nations Refugee Agency to receive dry clothes and medical attention.

None of those rescued had safety equipment such as life jackets, the coastguard said.

Greece’s caretaker prime minister, Ioannis Sarmas, declared three days of national mourning, “with our thoughts on all the victims of the ruthless smugglers who exploit human unhappiness”.

The Italy-bound boat is believed to have sailed from the Tobruk area in eastern Libya.

Greek authorities did not immediately confirm its port of departure but a shipping ministry official said most of those on board were from Egypt, Syria and Pakistan.

Greek officials and the EU border protection agency Frontex were first alerted about the approaching vessel on Tuesday.

After that first alert, Frontex aircraft and two merchant ships spotted the boat heading north at high speed, according to the Greek coastguard. More aircraft and ships were sent to the area. But repeated calls to the vessel offering help were declined, the coastguard said.

“In the afternoon a merchant vessel approached the ship and provided it with food and supplies, while the [passengers] refused any further assistance,” it said. A second merchant ship that approached it later offered further supplies and assistance, which were turned down, it added.

In the evening, a coastguard patrol boat reached the vessel “and confirmed the presence of a large number of migrants on the deck”, the statement said. “But they refused any assistance and said they wanted to continue to Italy.”

Support service Alarm Phone said on Twitter it alerted authorities after being contacted on Tuesday by a boat in distress in the Greek Search and Rescue zone. “According to the people, there were 750 people on board,” it wrote on Twitter. “Contact was lost shortly after midnight.”

It was not clear if that was the vessel that sank.

Yiannis Karvelis, regional health director, described the situation as “tragic and very difficult”.

”I am afraid the number of victims will be higher because the number of the people on board was much higher than the boat’s capacity.”

Separately, on Wednesday, a yacht with more than 70 people on board was towed to a port on the south coast of the island of Crete after authorities received a distress call.

Rescue operations are common, but last month, the Greek government came under international pressure over video footage reportedly showing the forceful expulsion of migrants and refugees who were set adrift at sea.

Last year, nearly 3,800 people died on migration routes within and from the Middle East and North Africa, the highest number recorded there since 2017, according to data published on Tuesday by the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

The IOM’s Missing Migrants Project recorded 3,789 deaths in 2022 along sea and land routes in the region, including crossings of the Sahara Desert and Mediterranean Sea.",True,"['Refugee', 'Death', 'Migrant', 'Missing', 'Crossing', 'Accident', 'Boat', 'Rescue']"

The hull of the fishing trawler lifted out of the water as it sank, catapulting people from the top deck into the black sea below. In the darkness, they grabbed onto whatever they could to stay afloat, pushing each other underwater in a frantic fight for survival. Some were screaming, many began to recite their final prayers.

“I can still hear the voice of a woman calling out for help,” one survivor of the migrant boat disaster off the coast of Greece told CNN. “You’d swim and move floating bodies out of your way.”

With hundreds of people still missing after the overloaded vessel capsized in the Mediterranean on June 14, the testimonies of those who were onboard paint a picture of chaos and desperation. They also call into question the Greek coast guard’s version of events, suggesting more lives could have been saved, and may even point to fault on the part of Greek authorities.

Rights groups allege the tragedy is both further evidence and a result of a new pattern in illegal pushbacks of migrant boats to other nations’ waters, with deadly consequences.

This boat was carrying up to 750 Pakistani, Syrian, Egyptian and Palestinian refugees and migrants. Only 104 people have been rescued alive.

CNN has interviewed multiple survivors of the shipwreck and their relatives, all of whom have wished to remain anonymous for security reasons and the fear of retribution from authorities in both Greece and at home.

One survivor from Syria, whom CNN is identifying as Rami, described how a Greek coast guard vessel approached the trawler multiple times to try to attach a rope to tow the ship, with disastrous results.

“The third time they towed us, the boat swayed to the right and everyone was screaming, people began falling into the sea, and the boat capsized and no one saw anyone anymore,” he said. “Brothers were separated, cousins were separated.”

Another Syrian man, identified as Mostafa, also believes it was the maneuver by the coast guard that caused the disaster. “The Greek captain pulled us too fast, it was extremely fast, this caused our boat to sink,” he said.

The Hellenic Coast Guard has repeatedly denied attempting to tow the vessel. An official investigation into the cause of the tragedy is still ongoing.

Coast guard spokesman Nikos Alexiou told CNN over the phone last week: “When the boat capsized, we were not even next to (the) boat. How could we be towing it?” Instead, he insisted they had only been “observing at a close distance” and that “a shift in weight probably caused by panic” had caused the boat to tip.

The Hellenic Coast Guard has declined to answer CNN’s specific requests for response to the survivor testimonies.

Direct accounts from those who survived the wreck have been limited, due to their concerns about speaking out and the media having little access to the survivors. CNN interviewed Rami and Mostafa outside the Malakasa migrant camp near Athens, where journalists are not permitted entry.

The Syrian men said the conditions on board the migrant boat deteriorated fast in the more than five days after it set off from Tobruk, Libya, in route to Italy. They had run out of water and had resorted to drinking from storage bottles that people had urinated in.

“People were dying. People were fainting. We used a rope to dip clothes into the sea and use that to squeeze water on people who had lost consciousness,” Rami said.

CNN’s analysis of marine traffic data, combined with information from NGOs, merchant vessels and the European Union border patrol agency, Frontex, suggests that Greek authorities were aware of the distressed vessel for at least 13 hours before it eventually sank early on June 14.

The Greek coast guard has maintained that people onboard the trawler had refused rescue and insisted they wanted to continue their journey to Italy. But survivors, relatives and activists say they had asked for help multiple times.

Earlier in the day, other ships tried to help the trawler. Directed by the Greek coast guard, two merchant vessels – Lucky Sailor and Faithful Warrior – approached the boat between 6 and 9 p.m. on June 13 to offer supplies, according to marine traffic data and the logs of those ships. But according to survivors this only caused more havoc onboard.

“Fights broke out over food and water, people were screaming and shouting,” Mostafa said. “If it wasn’t for people trying to calm the situation down, the boat was on the verge of sinking several times.”

By early evening, six people had already died onboard, according to an audio recording reviewed by CNN from Italian activist Nawal Soufi, who took a distress call from the migrant boat at around 7 p.m. Soufi’s communication with the vessel also corroborated Mostafa’s account that people moved from one side of the boat to the other after water bottles were passed from the cargo ships, causing it to sway dangerously.

The haunting final words sent from the migrant boat came just minutes before it capsized. According to a timeline published by NGO Alarm Phone they received a call, at around 1:45 a.m., with the words “Hello my friend… The ship you send is…” Then the call cuts out.

The coast guard says the vessel began to sink at around 2 a.m.

The next known activity in the area, according to marine traffic data, was the arrival of a cluster of vessels starting around 3 a.m. The Mayan Queen superyacht was the first on the scene for what soon became a mass rescue operation.

A responsibility to rescue

Human rights groups say the authorities had a duty to act to save lives, regardless of what people on board were saying to the coast guard before the migrant boat capsized.

“The boat was overcrowded, was unseaworthy and should have been rescued and people taken to safety, that’s quite clear,” UNHCR Special Envoy for the Central Mediterranean Vincent Cochetel told CNN in an interview. “There was a responsibility for the Greek authorities to coordinate a rescue to bring those people safely to land.”

Cochetel also pointed to a growing trend by countries, including Greece, to assist migrant boats in leaving their waters. “That’s a practice we’ve seen in recent months. Some coastal states provide food, provide water, sometimes life jackets, sometimes even fuel to allow such boats to continue to only one destination: Italy. And that’s not fair, Italy cannot cope with that responsibility alone.”

Survivors who say the coast guard tried to tow their boat say they don’t know what the aim was.

There have been multiple documented examples in recent years of Greek patrol boats engaging in so-called “pushbacks” of migrant vessels from Greek waters in recent years, including in a CNN investigation in 2020.

“It looks like what the Greeks have been doing since March 2020 as a matter of policy, which is pushbacks and trying to tow a boat to another country’s water in order to avoid the legal responsibility to rescue,” Omer Shatz, legal director of NGO Front-LEX, told CNN. “Because rescue means disembarkation and disembarkation means processing of asylum requests.”

Pushbacks are state measures aimed at forcing refugees and migrants out of their territory, while impeding access to legal and procedural frameworks, according to the Berlin-based European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR). They are a violation of international law, as well as European regulations.

And such measures do not appear to have deterred human traffickers whose businesses prey on vulnerable and desperate migrants.

In an interview with CNN last month, then Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis denied that his country engaged in intentional pushbacks and described them as a “completely unacceptable practice.” Mitsotakis is widely expected to win a second term in office in Sunday’s election, after failing to get an outright majority in a vote last month.

A series of Greek governments have been criticized for their handling of migration policy, including conditions in migrant camps, particularly following the 2015-16 refugee crisis, when more than 1 million people entered Europe through the country.

For those who lived through last week’s sinking, the harrowing experience will never be forgotten.

Mostafa and Rami both say they wish they had never made the journey, despite the fact they are now in Europe and are able to claim asylum.

Most of all, Mostafa says, he wishes the Greek coast guard had never approached their boat: “If they had left us be, we wouldn’t have drowned.”",True,"['Refugee', 'Migrant', 'Missing', ' Body', 'Asylum', 'Boat', 'Rescue']"

The two maritime tragedies that gripped attention in recent days could barely be more different.

Last Wednesday, a fishing trawler carrying more than 700 migrants primarily from Egypt, Syria and Pakistan went down off the coast of Greece, in one of the worst such disasters in more than a decade. Though the death toll is officially at 81, Greek authorities have only counted 104 survivors. Their testimony suggests all the women and children aboard perished. By some estimates, more than 300 Pakistani nationals on the boat died, with one account alleging many were forced to stay below deck in the hold as the ship capsized and sank.

Shocking as it is, this disaster in the Mediterranean is all too familiar to a global public largely numb to the plight of those making the perilous crossing. The migrants fell victim to a familiar chain of misfortunes: They were exploited by people-smuggling networks that stretched from their countries of origin to the coast of Libya. With the threat of violence, they were forced onto an overcrowded, unseaworthy, ill-equipped boat. The ship that took them to their deaths was stranded for days on its intended journey to Italy without help, despite apparent distress calls made by the migrants. And they endured this all in a desperate attempt to find asylum on a continent whose governments have failed to come up with a collective plan on migration and where many locals would rather push them back into the sea.

Far away in the North Atlantic, a cinematic ordeal is playing out that has news media and the global public riveted. Somewhere near the famous wreck of the Titanic, a deep-sea submersible is missing. At the time of writing, the search for the 21-foot craft, known as the Titan, was entering its fourth day after it lost contact with Canadian research vessel Polar Prince on Sunday morning. The U.S. Coast Guard and Royal Canadian Air Force had scrambled to locate the submersible over a vast 10,000-square mile search zone in the ocean, which reaches 13,000 feet deep in some areas. U.S. officials feared that the five passengers aboard, if still alive, had not much more than a day of oxygen left.

The Titan was carrying out a dive organized by OceanGate Expeditions, a private research and tourism company that has conducted trips to the Titanic wreck site. Its passengers reportedly pay $250,000 a head to go on the journey. Though the names of those on board had not been released by authorities, reporting confirmed that British businessman and explorer Hamish Harding, French diver Paul-Henri Nargeolet and OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush were inside the Titan. So too were Shahzada Dawood, heir to one of Pakistan’s biggest private fortunes, and his teenage son Suleman.

“[They] had embarked on a journey to visit the remnants of the Titanic in the Atlantic Ocean,” the Dawood family said in a statement. “As of now, contact has been lost with their submersible craft and there is limited information available.”

On social media, some Pakistanis pointed to the grim spectacle of compatriots from opposite ends of a great socioeconomic divide disappearing in the watery depths at the same time. Pakistan is in the middle of a devastating economic crisis, with the rate of inflation at a 50-year high, food shortages, energy blackouts and mounting unemployment. The conditions have compelled numerous people, especially among the poor, to seek a better life abroad.

“The desperate situation has led to the mushrooming growth of people smugglers in Pakistan,” wrote Zahid Shahab Ahmed, a senior research fellow at the Alfred Deakin Institute for Citizenship and Globalization in Australia. “In exchange for large sums of money, they offer people transportation, fake documentation and other resources for a swift departure from the country.”

“It is bad enough that the spectacular failure of the government to fulfill its part of the social contract by providing economic security to its citizens drives desperate individuals — even the educated ones — to leave the country,” noted a Monday editorial in Dawn, a Pakistani daily, further lamenting that “an inept, uncaring government has made little effort to crack down on a vast network of human smugglers who fleece desperate individuals and put them on a path strewn with hazards.”

Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declared Monday a national day of mourning, while authorities in various parts of the country arrested people suspected of links to human-trafficking networks. “Our thoughts and prayers are with you, and we pray that the departed souls find eternal peace,” the chairman of Pakistan’s Senate, Muhammad Sadiq Sanjrani, said, vowing to take on the people smugglers.

That may be cold comfort to many Pakistanis, who live in what by some measures is South Asia’s most unequal society, one long dominated by influential, quasi-feudal potentates. Sharif himself is a scion of a political dynasty that also has huge business interests.

The Dawoods belong to the same world. Shahzada Dawood is vice chairman of Engro Corp., a major conglomerate that is a subsidiary of family-owned Dawood Hercules, fronted by his father, Hussain Dawood. It’s a multibillion-dollar operation that sprawls over various sectors of Pakistan’s economy, including textiles, fertilizers, foods and energy. As a result, Engro has been the beneficiary of hefty government subsidies. Both Dawood and Sharif were identified in the 2016 Panama Papers leak among the dozens of Pakistani tycoons and politicos to possess secret offshore bank accounts.

Dawood frequented the World Economic Forum, touted his vision for a “sustainable future” and business models that help uplift “low-income communities.” The Dawoods are also engaged in philanthropic work in Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates and Britain, where Shahzada Dawood and his immediate family are based as dual British-Pakistani citizens.

The hundreds of Pakistanis lost in the Mediterranean were chasing just a glimmer of that life. Speaking to the Associated Press, Zohaib Shamraiz, a Pakistani man living in Barcelona, described his last conversation with his uncle, Nadeem Muhamm, who was still missing. Shamraiz’s uncle had left behind three young children in Pakistan to make a better life for his impoverished family.

While just over 100 migrants were rescued at sea, officials have recovered more than 80 bodies and as many as 500 people, including children, are still missing and feared to be dead, according to Greek authorities and United Nations officials. Several men arrested by Greek officials have been accused of smuggling the African and Middle Eastern migrants on the fishing trawler.

The humanitarian catastrophe has shined an international spotlight on the perilous voyage across the Mediterranean Sea that thousands of migrants undertake each month in hopes of reaching Europe, as well as the increasingly strict migration policies adopted by European countries amid mass refugee flows and intensifying migrant resentment domestically. It has also raised questions about the actions, or lack thereof, of Greek authorities before the boat capsized.

Here's what you need to know about the tragedy.

What happened?

On June 13, a plane administered by Frontex, the European Union's border agency, spotted a fishing boat in international waters near Greece that was ""heavily overcrowded"" and ""navigating at slow speed."" The agency said it notified Italian and Greek officials of the sighthing and the boat's location.

""The plane was monitoring the fishing vessel for 10 minutes before it had to return to base for refuelling. Frontex offered additional aerial support to Greek authorities on [June 13] but received no response,"" the agency said in a statement to CBS News. Frontex added that Greek officials asked the agency to instead send a drone to another migrant rescue incident further east, off the coast of Crete.

Video taken by the Frontex plane shows the boat was extremely overcrowded that day, with scores of migrants seen shoulder-to-shoulder on top of the vessel alone. The United Nations migration agency estimated that the vessel was carrying between 400 and 750 migrants.

The Greek Coast Guard said it asked nearby vessels to assist the fishing trawler, and later dispatched its own boat after being notified of the incident. The Greek Coast Guard said one of its boats reached the location of the distressed trawler during the evening of June 13. According to the Coast Guard, migrants on the boat rejected the assistance offer and said they want to continue their journey to Italy.

In the early morning of June 14, Greek Coast Guard officials said, the fishing boat capsized and sank roughly 47 nautical miles from the coastal city of Pylos on the Peloponnese peninsula. Greek officials have said the boat's engine failed.

The survivors who were rescued were transported to Kalamata, a city on the Greek mainland, the Coast Guard added. In a statement to CBS News, the United Nations refugee agency said the migrants on the boat hailed from Afghanistan, Egypt, Libya, the Palestinian territories, Pakistan and Syria. One town in Pakistan lost an entire generation of its young men.

As of June 28, Greek authorities have confirmed rescuing 104 survivors and recovering 82 bodies.

What have the survivors said?

Survivors of the tragedy have told news outlets that the fishing boat was severely overcrowded. Some said the boat began to move after other vessels offered supplies and people on board fought over them.

Other survivors have told news outlets that Greek authorities tried to tow the boat, which caused the vessel to move back and forth. Some of them have partially blamed Greek officials for the tragedy. Greek government officials have so far denied that authorities tried to tow the boat, suggesting that the trawler sank because of the engine's failure and movement by the migrants.

But United Nation officials and other advocates for migrants have said that Greek authorities had a duty to intervene earlier on and get the migrants off the boat, even if they had refused assistance.

""The duty to rescue people in distress at sea without delay is a fundamental rule of international maritime law,"" the United Nations refugee agency said in a statement. ""Both shipmasters and States have an obligation to render assistance to those in distress at sea regardless of their nationality, status or the circumstances in which they are found, including on unseaworthy vessels, and irrespective of the intentions of those onboard.""

In a statement, the Greek government said several questions posed by CBS News were being investigated and could not be answered due to legal restrictions tied to an ongoing probe.

Are these tragedies common?

Yes. Deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea have become increasingly common as the number of people taking to the sea in hopes of reaching Europe has increased.

More than 27,000 migrants have died or disappeared in the Mediterranean Sea since 2014, according to the International Organization for Migration, the United Nations migration agency. In the first six months of 2023, the agency recorded nearly 2,000 deaths and disappearances of migrants in the Mediterranean. Officials have said these figures are likely undercounted due to data collection limits.

The majority of migrant deaths have occurred in the central Mediterranean, the sea's busiest migration corridor. Frontex, the EU border agency, recorded over 50,000 migrant detections in the central Mediterranean during the first 5 months of 2023 alone, a 160% increase from the same period in 2022.

Over the past decade, individual disasters have claimed the lives of hundreds of migrants. In 2014, roughly 500 migrants died when a boat sank off the coast of Malta.

What are Greece and Europe's policies towards migrants?

Following the arrival of more than 1 million mostly Syrian refugees to Europe in 2015, many countries on the continent adopted more restrictive asylum and migration policies, in part due to the rise of far-right political parties that employed anti-migrant rhetoric to galvanize frustrated voters.

While EU member states still have relatively generous asylum laws on paper, several countries like Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Italy and Greece have sought to stiffen border controls, tighten asylum rules and increase deportations. Even Sweden, which welcomed the highest number of refugees during the 2015 crisis alongside Germany, has recently proposed restricting migration.

The increasingly hardline policies have predominantly targeted new arrivals from Africa and the Middle East. Following the exodus of millions of refugees from Ukraine following the Russian invasion, all European countries, including Poland and Hungary, welcomed the displaced Ukrainians with open arms.

The Greek government, which has complained of shouldering a disproportionate burden of refugee flows due to Greece's position in the Mediterranean and proximity to Asia, has long been accused by human rights officials of mistreating migrants and breaching international law. Reports have documented instances of Greek officials abandoning asylum-seekers, including women and children, at sea, in violation of international refugee law and EU policy.",True,"['Refugee', 'Death', 'Migrant', 'Missing', 'Asylum', 'Seeker', 'Boat', 'Rescue']"
19,23,Grief shrouds remote Pakistan mountain village after Greece migrant boat tragedy - CNN,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8yMS9hc2lhL3Bha2lzdGFuLWdyZWVjZS1ib2F0LXRyYWdlZHkta2FzaG1pci12aWxsYWdlLWludGwtaG5rL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAV1odHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIzLzA2LzIxL2FzaWEvcGFraXN0YW4tZ3JlZWNlLWJvYXQtdHJhZ2VkeS1rYXNobWlyLXZpbGxhZ2UtaW50bC1obms?oc=5,"Thu, 22 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT","Bandali, Pakistan-administered Kashmir CNN —

An air of melancholy engulfs the small village of Bandali in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, where hopes are fading fast for nearly two dozen residents who went abroad in search of a better life and have since disappeared.

Families fight back tears as they yearn to hear what may have happened to their loved ones – all migrants aboard the boat, reportedly known as the Adriana, an overcrowded fishing trawler that capsized off the coast of Greece last week, killing at least 81 people and leaving hundreds more missing.

In Pakistan, authorities said more than 300 of its nationals died in the tragedy, but did not specify how they received the information. On Thursday, the Federal Investigation Agency of Pakistan said it has confirmed 92 deaths in the incident by collecting DNA samples of family members who reported their loved ones as missing to assist with the identification of victims.

Bandali, population 12,000, is just one of many Pakistani communities reeling from the disaster – about 22 people from this village alone remain unaccounted for, according to residents.

Their loved ones now face an agonizing wait as authorities in Greece attempt to account for the dead, flicking through WhatsApp chats on their phones that have now fallen silent, all victims of a refugee crisis engulfing the European Union as tens of thousands seek sanctuary from war, persecution and poverty.

Saeed Anwar said four family members were now missing – including his brother Abdul Jabbar. A selfie sent to Anwar’s phone from the group before they disappeared showed the four men smiling, their goal of reaching Europe close by.

Jabbar, 36, paid a human trafficker more than $7,500 in the hope of making it to Italy, traversing thousands of miles across dangerous routes from his home country to give his young daughters a better future, Anwar told CNN. Jabbar left his two daughters in the village while he went ahead with the journey.

Pakistan, a nation of about 220 million, is in the throes of its worst economic crisis in decades. Work is scarce; inflation is soaring; and essentials including food and fuel are increasingly costly.

The precise route Jabbar and his three family members took is unclear. But they arrived in Libya days before boarding the ill-fated boat there, aiming for their final destination: Italy.

Phone conversations between Anwar and Jabbar in the days leading up to the tragedy highlight the grim conditions faced by those making a trip controlled by a lucrative and all too often merciless network of international smugglers.

In a video sent to Anwar by his brother from Libya, about 100 men could be seen sleeping in a small room, their bodies packed tightly together head to toe on the floor.

“The human traffickers were keeping the refugees hungry for 72 hours, or sometimes they gave them only bread after 24 hours,” Anwar said, adding they were kept in “crowded conditions.”

About 750 men, women and children were on the boat when it capsized last week, the United Nations Migration Agency (IOM) said.

CNN spoke to survivors in Greece who said it was crammed with people spread over three decks. The worst was the lowest deck, where it was nearly impossible for travelers to roam or move to higher ground.

Many Pakistanis were on the bottom deck, survivors said.

A dangerous journey

The Mediterranean, particularly Greece’s many southern islands, is a key route for migrants and refugees attempting to flee political strife and poverty in the Middle East, Asia and Africa.

Greek authorities have faced criticism for how the disaster was handled, and uncomfortable questions have been raised about European countries’ attitudes toward migrants.

Last week, Greek authorities denied claims that the boat had capsized after the coast guard attempted to tow it to shore.

Authorities had initially said the coast guard kept its distance but their assistance “had been declined” after they threw a rope to the vessel to “stabilize and check if it needed help.”

But Tarek Aldroobi, a man who had three relatives on board, told CNN that they had seen Greek authorities towing the vessel with ropes – but says they were tied in the “wrong places,” which caused it to capsize.

Back in Bandali, shopkeeper Raja Aqeel, was praying for the families waiting to hear about their loved ones.

His own brother made the treacherous journey out of Pakistan to Libya, but “luckily” survived as he didn’t board the ill-fated boat that went down.

Now, Aqeel is desperately trying to bring his brother home, three months after he first set off on his journey to Europe.

While Greek authorities have accounted for 81 of the dead, hundreds remain missing, making it one of the worst disasters of its kind in the Mediterranean sea, according to the EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson.

Johansson condemned the role of “smugglers” who put people on the boats.

“They are not sending them to Europe, they are sending them to death, she said. “This is what they’re doing and it’s absolutely necessary to prevent it.”

Authorities in Pakistan say they have started to crack down on human trafficking networks in the country, arresting more than 20 “human smugglers” and “more than five traffickers.”

The country’s investigation authority said special teams have been formed in the capital Islamabad, as well as the cities of Lahore, Gujrat, Gujranwala and Rawalpindi, to arrest other suspects.

The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan in a statement on Monday said the deaths from the shipwreck were “avoidable.”

It called on authorities to “take responsibility for its part in this disaster,” while also acknowledging “that the dearth of economic opportunities available in the country compels more and more people to take their chances on such routes without being aware of the risk.”

The tragedy “should serve as a stark reminder to the state that it has failed to stem a longstanding and grievous human rights violation,” it said.",True,"['Refugee', 'Death', 'Migrant', 'Missing', 'Boat', 'Rescue']"

Naysayers, Mitsotakis said at a campaign stop in the town of Sparta, should turn their ire against traffickers he called “human scum.” The vessel sank on Wednesday.

The Greek coast guard announced Saturday that one Greek Navy frigate and four other vessels were operating 47 nautical miles (54 miles; 87 kilometers) southwest of the town of Pylos in Greece’s southwest. Earlier, two helicopters from the navy and coast guard joined the operation, the coast guard said.

The rescue operation is taking place in rough seas, with near gale-force winds, and in some of the Mediterranean Sea’s deepest waters. at over 5,000 meters (3 miles).

To date, 104 survivors have been rescued and 78 bodies have been recovered. The trawler carried as many as 750 men, women and children from Syria, Egypt, the Palestinian territories and Pakistan. No survivors or bodies have been found since the day of the accident.

The survivors have been taken to a migrant reception center outside Athens. A few have been visited by relatives residing in other European countries.

The Egyptian embassy in Athens on Saturday shared a list of 43 Egyptian migrants, including minors, who survived the shipwreck. The survivors are all men from Cairo and the Nile Delta provinces of Sharqia and Menofia, the list shows. The embassy said the list was provided by Greek authorities.

Greek authorities continue to face criticism, however, over their failure to act more quickly. They say the migrants insisted they didn’t need any help, but non-governmental organizations say they received a number of calls for help.

On Saturday, parts of the Greek rescue vessel captain’s testimony were published by Greek media. In it he said the migrants refused help, saying they were going to Italy, and untied a rope loosely tied to the trawler’s bow when the coast guard ship had gone closer to inspect.

“It is very unfair for some so-called ‘people in solidarity’ to insinuate that the (Coast Guard) did not do its job. … These people are out there battling the waves to rescue human lives and protect our borders,” Mitsotakis said.

Mitsotakis, the favorite to win a second four-year term in elections on June 25, attacked the main opposition party Syriza for its own record on migration while in government.

“Those who today appear as the so-called authentic humanitarians are those who allowed detention camps such as Moria to exist. The same who, a few days ago, were condemned by the European Court of Human Rights for the wretched conditions at Moria.”

The notoriously overcrowded migrant camp of Moria, on the island of Lesbos across from the Turkish coast, opened in January 2013 under a three-party coalition government led by New Democracy. It saw its population swell during the migration crisis of 2015. It operated throughout the Syriza administration from 2015-19 and burned down in September 2020. Just before it did, it was estimated that 20,000 people lived in a camp designed to accommodate 3,000.

Mitsotakis also attacked Syriza for “opening the doors to millions of people” in 2015 and defended his own more restrictive policies, vowing to continue them.

“We followed a different migration policy … fair and strict, of monitoring and guarding our borders. A policy which resulted in illegal crossings dropping 90 percent,” he told the crowd. “This policy has been acknowledged (by Europe) as the right one. Because if we leave Europe’s borders to allow in everyone, then the numbers of those wanting to cross the Mediterranean will rise exponentially and so will the chances of tragic shipwrecks.”

Separately on Saturday, a successful rescue operation took place in Italy, where a coast guard vessel from the port of Roccella, in Calabria, rescued 96 migrants on a sailboat more than 100 nautical miles (115 miles; 185 kilometers) from the port.

Turbulent seas made the rescue difficult but with the assistance of a Portuguese coast guard vessel operating for Frontex, the European Union’s border agency, and several commercial vessels, the rescue was completed.

Four survivors who reached the Italian island of Lampedusa told rescuers that they were on a boat carrying forty-five people, including three children, the Ansa news agency reported.

The boat initially set off on Thursday from the city of Sfax in Tunisia — a notorious hotbed for migrant smuggling — but the boat turned over and sank within a few hours of departure, Ansa reported, citing accounts from the survivors.

The survivors consisted of three men and a woman from Ivory Coast and Guinea who said they had initially been rescued by a cargo ship, before being transferred onto an Italian coast guard ship.

Questions remain regarding whether these survivor accounts are connected to two shipwrecks that occurred on Sunday, with the Italian Coast Guard saying around 30 people were missing from one wreck.

Refugees in Libya, a non-governmental organization that works to ensure the safe arrival of refugees, said in a social media post Sunday that the Italian coastguard had recovered 57 survivors and two bodies in that particular incident.

In another operation, 34 migrants were airlifted by helicopter by Italy's emergency mountain rescue service on Sunday after being stranded on a cliff in Lampedusa — located in the Sicily region in southern Italy — and geographically closer to Tunisia than it is to the Italian mainland.

Government data from Italy's Interior ministry shows that around 93,700 migrants arrived to Italy by sea this year, with the most prominent nationalities of migrants being from Guinea and the Ivory Coast.

CNN —

The man who drove a vehicle into a group of people near a migrant shelter in Brownsville, Texas, on Sunday, killing eight and injuring 10 more, has been charged with eight counts of manslaughter, Brownsville Police chief Felix Sauceda said Monday.

The driver was identified as George Alvarez, a 34-year-old with an extensive rap sheet, including prior charges of assault and driving while intoxicated, according to police. The vehicle he was driving ran a red light, lost control, flipped on its side and hit a total of 18 people, the chief said. Alvarez then tried to flee the scene before he was detained by bystanders, police said.

He was charged on the manslaughter counts as well as 10 counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and his bond was set at $3.6 million, the chief said. Police said they are still investigating the cause of the crash.

Several immigrants were among those killed when the Land Rover hit the group waiting at a bus stop across the street from the Bishop Enrique San Pedro Ozanam Center, a non-profit homeless shelter helping to house migrants in the border town, authorities say.

Surveillance video of the incident shows the vehicle driving at a high rate of speed and hitting a curb about 30 feet from where the migrants were sitting before the driver appears to lose control, according to Victor Maldonado, the director of the Ozanam Center in Brownsville.

There were about 20 to 25 migrants sitting on the curb at around 8:30 a.m. when police reported receiving reports of the crash, according to the shelter’s director. The migrants were from Venezuela and had arrived at the shelter just days ago, Maldonado said.

“The staff and residents of the Ozanam Center are devastated by Sunday’s tragic event,” Maldonado said in a statement. “The individuals injured and killed are asylum-seekers. They came seeking refuge. They were staying at our shelter because they arrived in this country with very little.”

The driver received medical care and was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving, Brownsville Police spokesman Martin Sandoval said. Seven victims are still in the hospital and three have been released, Sandoval told CNN Monday.

The fatal crash comes as border towns like Brownsville are bracing for a migrant surge when the public health emergency measure known as Title 42 lapses on Thursday. US Customs and Border Protection officials already have seen an uptick in migrants at the border with Mexico in anticipation of the expiration of Title 42.

CNN interviewed migrants staying at the Ozanam Center in December. At the time, the center’s director said migrants from all over the world were starting to stay at his shelter and he was seeing an uptick in stays.

Located on the southern tip of Texas, Brownsville’s population is nearly 95% Hispanic or Latino, according to the 2022 census.

The city recently declared a state of emergency after receiving an influx of thousands of migrants, many from Venezuela, in the past several weeks, CNN previously reported.

After the crash, witnesses at the scene detained the driver until officers arrived, police said. Exclusive video obtained by CNN shows a group of people trying to restrain the man after the crash.

Cesar Romero, 34, is a Venezuelan national who said he witnessed the crash and saw his friends run over by the vehicle.

“Some of the men killed had just arrived the night before,” he said while tears rolled down his face.

Romero said after the crash, the driver exited his vehicle and appeared to be impaired. He said the driver tried to run away and yelled obscenities, but witnesses stopped him.

Sandoval told CNN that investigators were made aware of the video Monday morning.

“The video is part of a separate incident investigation but related to the accident,” Sandoval said. “We are looking at what the DA can formulate from the video to see if they have enough to potentially face charges.”

“We are looking at it three different ways,” Sandoval said. “One, to see if he was intoxicated. We took a blood sample, and we have to turn it over to the Texas DPS crime lab. Two, we have to look at it as a malfunction of the car. Or three it could be intentional. All of these are possibilities.”

The driver was uncooperative after the crash and gave authorities different names, Sandoval said. A blood sample was also taken from the driver and a toxicology test will be ordered, he added.

At the scene of the fatal crash Sunday, investigators were examining the mangled Range Rover, which could be seen with its windshield shattered and its driver-side door and hood damaged.

As the death toll from the Texas crash rose to eight, witnesses described the horrifying moment the driver plowed into the group.

The shelter director and a staff member ran out to the street to find a very graphic scene, with body parts spread across the area, Maldonado told CNN.

“I’ve got a staff (member) who is in shock,” Maldonado said, adding he, too, was in shock.

Another witness described the vehicle overturning as it hit the crowd.

“I could hear the car hitting people and the thumping and I saw how the SUV rolled over when he hit them,” witness Jose Del Transito Rubio Armijo told KRGV in Spanish.

Witnesses have also described seeing the driver ignore a red light before driving up on a curb and running over people at the bus stop, according to Sandoval.

The FBI is assisting local police with the investigation and Border Patrol is working to confirm the identities of the victims, authorities said.

Police are set to provide more information about the crash during a Monday morning news conference.

Community members marked a solemn Sunday mass at the Ozanam Center Sunday evening, just hours after the deadly crash across the street.

“As we await a fuller report from law enforcement authorities, let us stop for a moment to mourn these losses of life and to pray. Pray for the victims, pray for the families and loved ones, and pray for our community,” Bishop Daniel Flores of the Catholic Diocese of Brownsville said in a statement.

“We must resist the corrosive tendency to devalue the lives of immigrants, the poor, and the vulnerable. Let us take extra steps as a local community to care for and protect one another, especially the most vulnerable,” Flores said.",True,"['Death', 'Migrant', ' Body', 'Asylum', 'Seeker', 'Accident']"

On a boat overpacked with migrants, water had run out and the situation was deteriorating.

Yet the Greek coast guard did not call for a high-priority rescue operation. In subsequent hours, officials maintained the vessel was proceeding with a “steady course and speed” and people on board didn’t want help. Greek officials deny responsibility for what happened that night, when the migrant boat, a fishing trawler known as the Adriana, capsized and sent as many as 750 people into the Mediterranean Sea.

The conflicting accounts of the Adriana’s final minutes are the most fraught — whether the boat capsized as a result of a panic-induced shift in weight, as the coast guard contends, or it overturned while being towed by the coast guard, as some survivors have described.

But an investigation by The Washington Post also casts doubt on the other main claims by Greek officials and suggests that the deadliest Mediterranean shipwreck in years was a preventable tragedy.

[They knew the boat could sink. Boarding it didn’t feel like a choice.]

Contrary to the coast guard account that the boat was making steady progress and determined to get to Italy, The Post found the boat’s speed fluctuated dramatically — in line with passenger recollections of engine problems — while circling back on its route.

Maritime rescue veterans and legal experts said Greek officials exploited indications that aid wasn’t wanted and failed in their obligation to launch an all-hands rescue effort as soon as the precarious boat was detected.

“This is egregious,” said Aaron Davenport, a retired senior officer in the U.S. Coast Guard who commanded sea rescue operations, including those involving migrants. “They sent a helicopter out there. They should have sent a whole bunch of vessels, called for assistance from all over the lower Mediterranean, and gotten life preservers and gotten these people out.”

Coast guard spokesperson Nikos Alexiou said Greece should be recognized for ultimately helping to rescue 104 people. “We were there trying to get them to get help,” he said. “They didn’t realize the danger. [There was] good weather, they were sailing normally.”

Retracing the path of the Adriana

To retrace the path of the Adriana, The Post examined satellite imagery, mapped ship traffic data and integrated coordinates from distress calls and official reports and testimony. To reconstruct what happened, The Post then compared official statements, accounts from the merchant vessels and interviews with survivors, activists and maritime experts. All times are in Central European Summer Time (CEST).

The Adriana departs for Italy early on June 9 from a port in eastern Libya. Survivors recounted that they couldn’t believe how packed the boat was, with smugglers shouting at people to board long after it appeared to be full. Four days later, the Adriana is tracked heading toward Greece. Passengers connect with activist Nawal Soufi, who tweets that they need “immediate help” and alerts Italian, Greek and Maltese officials. The Italian coast guard notifies its Greek counterpart around 10 a.m. that the boat is in Greece’s search-and-rescue region. At 11:47 a.m., surveillance aircraft from the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, known as Frontex, spots the Adriana and assesses the boat is “heavily overcrowded” and traveling northeast “at a slow speed” of about 7 mph. Frontex sends video footage to Greek and Italian authorities. Over the next several hours, passengers make repeated distress calls to Soufi and Alarm Phone, a nonprofit hotline for refugees and migrants crossing the Mediterranean. The callers say they cannot survive the night. The Greek coast guard makes its first visual verification, by helicopter, at 2:35 p.m. and determines the boat is sailing “with a steady course and speed.” While a coast guard patrol transits from Crete, officials enlist a Maltese-flagged tanker, the Lucky Sailor, which spots the Adriana at 4:50 p.m. According to the tanker’s management company, about 200 people were on the decks of what appeared to be a 100-foot fishing boat, but “the weather conditions were good and nobody was at any imminent danger.” The Greek coast guard reports connecting by satellite phone at around 5:30 p.m. with an English-speaker on the Adriana, who says the boat is not in danger and only needs food and water before continuing to Italy. Alarm Phone, though, says it received multiple distress calls around that time. At 5:34 p.m., passengers say the boat is “moving from side to side.” The speed had dropped to 1.4 mph, according to The Post’s analysis. The Lucky Sailor crew records video of the trawler motoring away when approached and recounts that people on board gestured “go away” while shouting “Italy.” Eventually, the Adriana accepts food and water. Satellite imagery shows the vessels side by side at 6:39 p.m. The tanker departs two hours later. The Adriana does not continue on its previous course and instead heads southeast at a rate of 0.8 mph. That speed and direction is consistent with a boat drifting with the current, experts said. Survivor Haseeb Ur Rehman, a motorcycle mechanic from Pakistan-administered Kashmir, spoke of “repeated engine failure” on the last day. The coast guard enlists the Greek-flagged oil tanker Faithful Warrior , telling it to come as close to the trawler as possible, according to a copy of the ship’s logs. The logs note a similar pattern of resistance. Survivors said the tanker generated waves that threatened to overturn their boat. About 15 minutes after starting food and water deliveries, the Faithful Warrior ’s captain reports the trawler is “swaying dangerously,” which he attributes to the “excessive number of people on all decks.” Passengers tossed provisions into the sea, according to the ship’s log. The coast guard patrol arrives around 10:45 p.m. and connects a “small rope” to the Adriana, according to the patrol boat logs, which note: “The condition of the fishing boat was good but there was shouting and tension between the people onboard.” (The coast guard can’t be mapped precisely, as the agency conceals coordinates for security.) People on the Adriana reject help, untie the rope and restart their engine, the patrol boat logs say. The coast guard says it continues surveillance while the trawler moves west — away from Greece, toward its earlier position. It is moving at 4.5 mph, according to Post calculations. The patrol boat captain testified that the Adriana was “moving at low speed” at 11:44 p.m. Some survivors told The Post the coast guard was leading them toward Italy, but their boat had trouble keeping up. The Post’s analysis shows the trawler drifting in the direction of the current. The coast guard says it gets a call about engine trouble around 12:40 a.m. Multiple survivors said the coast guard tried to tow them. The coast guard denies this. The patrol boat captain said his vessel was 230 feet away when the trawler tilted right and capsized just after 1 a.m. The Adriana sank near the deepest point of the Mediterranean. More than 600 people may have drowned. The boat traveled at least 34 miles in its last 15 hours, averaging 2.2 mph, according to The Post’s calculations. At that pace, it would have needed five more days to reach the Italian coast.

Claim 1: The Adriana didn’t want help

The Greek coast guard defended its decision not to intervene earlier by emphasizing that the Adriana rejected help. The point is repeated five times in the official statement. “If any violent intervention was made on a fishing boat with people packed to the gills, we could have caused the maritime accident,” Alexiou said in an interview with broadcaster SKAI.

That people resisted assistance is echoed in an account provided by the Lucky Sailor’s management company, Eastern Mediterranean Maritime Limited, and in a copy of the Faithful Warrior’s logs obtained by The Post.

But analysts said the coast guard should have accounted for who was resisting and why, as well as for the repeated pleas for help received by an activist and a hotline. And legal experts insisted that authorities had an obligation to intervene, regardless of the wishes of some on board.

The smugglers would have resisted intervention to avoid apprehension.

Nine Egyptian men accused of crewing the trawler are being held in pretrial custody in Greece and face charges including illegal trafficking of foreigners, causing a shipwreck and negligent homicide. If convicted, they could be imprisoned for life. The Egyptian captain is not among them. Survivors said he died.

Among the passengers, to the extent that help was resisted, it may have been more about fear.

Greek authorities have a reputation — established through court cases, videos and other evidence — for aggressively pushing migrant boats out of the search-and-rescue area they are responsible for.

Adriana survivors recounted that when the coast guard patrol boat first arrived, some on board were wearing balaclavas. The crew included four members of a special operations unit, according to copy of the patrol boat’s logs obtained by The Post.

“Why are people at sea so afraid to encounter Greek forces? It is because people on the move know about the horrible and systematic pushback practices carried out by the Greek authorities, practices that are sanctioned by the EU,” Alarm Phone said in a statement.

Eva Cossé, a Greece-based senior researcher for Human Rights Watch, said episodes documented by her organization include coast guard vessels “circling around rubber boats holding asylum seekers and migrants, creating big waves — really risky and dangerous situations, putting lives at risk.”

Adriana survivors also recalled fears their boat would overturn while getting help from much larger ships.

A 30-year-old Syrian, who requested that he be referred to by his Arabic moniker, Abu Hussein, described the interaction with the Faithful Warrior: “They threw ropes to get closer, but as they pulled we almost capsized. They threw bottles of water, but as people tried to catch the bottles there was too much movement and again we almost capsized. One person shouted, ‘We don’t want water like that. Take us or we will drown.’ We never refused the water. We were scared that we will capsize. That’s why we cut the rope and we moved away.”

Mehtab Ali, a Pakistani passenger, posted on TikTok that the second ship to arrive — the Faithful Warrior — “created waves that [our] boat could not withstand.”

The Faithful Warrior’s management company did not respond to questions. But the ship’s logs note that after being told of the Adriana’s apparent resistance, the coast guard instructed the Faithful Warrior — estimated to be at least nine times the size of the Adriana — to try again and “approach as close as possible.”

Maritime rescue veterans said the question of why anyone rejected help should have mattered for thinking about how to approach the trawler and keep passengers calm, so they could be assisted and ideally evacuated without overturning their vessel. But none of that should have stood in the way of a rescue effort.

[For migrants giving up on Europe, Greece offers a way out: Voluntary deportation]

European law allows authorities to board and search a flagless vessel like the Adriana if there are reasonable grounds to suspect migrant smuggling. Moreover, international maritime law experts said the legal responsibility to rescue people in distress holds no matter their intent or immigration status.

“Time is essential,” said Giuseppe Cataldi of the University of Naples L’Orientale. “So once there is the perception of a dangerous situation, the duty is to intervene — not withstanding the attitude of the people on board.”

Claim 2: ‘A steady course and speed’

The coast guard maintains that earlier rescue wasn’t necessary, because the boat was okay, progressing at “a steady course and speed.” This assessment is noted three times in the official account, with the first mention of a malfunctioning engine only 24 minutes before the capsizing report. The patrol boat’s logs note that when checked at about 10:50 p.m., “there was shouting and tension between the people onboard” but “the condition of the fishing boat was good.”

The Adriana had been struggling for quite a while by then. That’s reflected in an erratic course combined with dramatic fluctuations in speed — from the nearly 7 mph reported by Frontex to just 0.5 mph.

The Post provided physicists and oceanographers with its estimates of the Adriana’s speed and direction, the known coordinates of the boat, and weather data from the Faithful Warrior, the Lucky Sailor and a ship involved after the capsizing, the Mayan Queen IV.

Contrary to BBC and New York Times reports that the Adriana was drifting for 6½ hours or more before it capsized, the Post analysis concluded that the boat was traveling under its own propulsion, albeit slowly, for periods of time. But the academics said the boat’s directional shift toward the southeast during at least two points in its journey — after its interaction with the Lucky Sailor and in the last hour before its capsizing — was consistent with engine problems, as the boat appeared to be drifting in the direction implied by local currents and winds.

The Greek coast guard declined to respond to detailed questions about The Post’s findings, citing an ongoing investigation.

A video clip shot from the Lucky Sailor around 6:15 p.m. is too short to draw many conclusions, but the experts who reviewed the footage said the Adriana appeared to have limited maneuverability and that so much smoke at such a slow speed could signal a mechanical problem with the engine.

Survivor Haseeb Ur Rehman, 20, a motorcycle mechanic from Kashmir, said the engine stopped working for about five hours on June 11 and again for a period on the night of June 12. “We knew we were in trouble,” he said, recalling how other passengers recited Quranic verses and cried.

On June 13, beginning around 2 p.m. — close to when a coast guard helicopter flew overhead — the engine failed repeatedly, he said. For two hours in the afternoon, “it felt like the boat was going in circles.” He said the engine stopped functioning again that night.

Beyond the engine, experts said, the instability of the Adriana should have been evident from the start.

The first distress calls noted the number of people on board. Aerial images taken by Frontex show the decks were overflowing. The coast guard helicopter observed a “considerable number of people on its outer decks.”

Trawlers are attractive for smuggling because they are built with generous space below deck to hold tons of fish. On the Adriana, that space was filled with people, including women and children. But such boats are not designed to carry so many people above.

“There’s nothing more tragic to reduce stability than raising your center of gravity,” said Jennifer Waters, a naval architecture expert at SUNY Maritime College. “Anybody who has been in a canoe knows that if they stand up, things get very rocky.”

An inherently unstable boat might be okay “if there were no waves, there was nothing going on,” she said.

“You can have something stable temporarily,” she said. “But then if you blow on it, it falls over.”

Claim 3: ‘How could we be towing it?’

Exactly what fatally destabilized the Adriana remains unresolved.

The coast guard says crowd movement on board, probably caused by panic, caused a sudden shift in weight, leading the boat to roll to one side, then the other, before it overturned.

Some survivors allege that the patrol boat tried to tow them toward Italy, causing the boat to capsize.

In the coast guard’s initial account, on June 14, it made no mention of a rope and said the patrol boat “remained at a distance.” After the survivor claims emerged, the agency said the patrol boat had used a “small rope” — but only to stabilize the vessel while checking on it, and only when it first arrived hours earlier.

“When the boat capsized, we were not even next to the boat,” Alexiou told The Post. “How could we be towing it?”

The patrol boat captain, Miltiadis Zouridakis, handed over a video recording to investigators. But no visual evidence has been made public of the moment the vessel capsized.

Rights groups say a towing claim is not so hard to believe in the context of systematic behavior by Greek patrols.

Last year, the European Court of Human Rights fined Greece for a pushback operation in 2014 that caused a migrant boat to sink off the coast of the island of Farmakonisi, killing 11 people, including children. In that incident, survivors said Greek authorities used a rope that was too short to tow their boat, too fast, causing it to sink.

Three survivors of the Adriana interviewed by The Post mentioned ropes being attached to the trawler just before it capsized. Two of those people cited towing.

[Dozens dead after migrant boat breaks apart near Italian coast]

The trawler had been instructed to follow the coast guard patrol toward Italian waters, but it struggled to keep up and eventually the engine failed, said Abu Hussein, the 30-year-old Syrian.

He said the coast guard attached a rope to the front of the trawler at an angle. The first rope snapped under pressure. “They then tried again and pulled hard. Our boat tilted to the right. We shouted ‘No. No. No.’ and they kept towing us until we capsized. They then cut the rope and moved further away.”

A 20-year-old Syrian survivor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions for his family in Syria, also said the coast guard began towing the boat at an angle.

“We were shouting for them to stop, but they were going too fast,” he said. “I fell in the water and people fell over me.”

These accounts align with those relayed to The Post by lawyers with the Greek Council for Refugees and by a Pakistani community leader in Greece, as well as with sworn testimonies leaked to Greek media.

In rescue operations, experts said, towing a boat in distress is almost never advisable.

Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement

It is a “really difficult” maneuver, especially with so many people on board, said Riccardo Gatti, search-and-rescue team leader for Doctors Without Borders.

A former Mediterranean coast guard official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because his current position does not allow him to speak on the record, said the Greek patrol boat would have faced difficult choices.

“If you tow them, you may destroy the vessel because … it’s completely unseaworthy. If you don’t tow it, it could capsize on its own. If you try to divert the course, you could make it capsize,” he said.

Sometimes, he said, this leads to a hands-off approach: “Whatever you do can be tragically wrong. … So you just let them sail and hope for the best.”

He acknowledged that Greece — as a Southern European country that believes it bears a disproportion burden for rescuing, processing and assimilating asylum seekers — also has a political interest in seeing migrant boats move out of the waters it is responsible for.

“It’s an open secret that no country wants to take them,” he said. “The Greeks would be happy if the ships were to continue to sail and eventually get out of the Greek search-and-rescue region, going to Italy.”

Claim 4: ‘We did what we had to do’

The coast guard maintains it fulfilled all its obligations in the case of the Adriana — locating the ship, enlisting merchant vessels, sending its own patrol boat. “We did what we had to do,” Alexiou said.

Yet maritime rescue and legal experts said that based on information it had early in the day, the coast guard should have initiated a full-scale rescue operation. “You are not responsible for saving every life,” said Efthymios Papastavridis, an international maritime law researcher at Oxford University. “But you have to discharge all your best efforts.”

Greece “should have called for assistance by other vessels,” including Italian search-and-rescue boats and potentially Frontex assets, Papastavridis said.

The coast guard said that “immediately” after its helicopter observed the Adriana at 2:35 p.m., it instructed ships in the area to change course and help monitor the trawler. In a distress call about 20 minutes earlier, passengers reported they could see two ships nearby. But it is not evident that either played a role. The Lucky Sailor account and Faithful Warrior logs say they were called in hours later. The luxury megayacht Mayan Queen IV wasn’t enlisted until after the capsizing.

The private ships acted according to their obligations under international law. “But the question is, why were these people not rescued by state actors that were aware of this case for hours and hours?” said Oliver Kulikowski, a spokesman for Sea Watch, a nonprofit rescue group. “The problem you have with merchant vessels is the crew is not trained for this and the ship is not prepared for this.”

The single vessel the coast guard sent from Crete — the 920 — can hold up to 16 crew members and 20 passengers, according to the builder’s specifications. In other words, it is not designed to save hundreds of people on its own. Alexiou, the coast guard spokesperson, acknowledged this while speaking to The Post about why the coast guard couldn’t have been towing the Adriana. “Let’s not mix up the big boats, specialized rescue boats, that have specialized ropes to tow boats,” he said.

Another fatal omission by the Greek coast guard, experts said, was not providing flotation devices as soon as possible. In copies of testimony obtained by The Post, the patrol boat captain first mentions throwing life rings and life jackets after people were already in the water. The captain of the Mayan Queen IV, which arrived about 45 minutes later and rescued 15 men, said in testimony obtained by Greek media that no one was wearing a life vest — some of those saved had clung to floating wood.

Coming to the aid of a vessel carrying as many people as the Adriana is challenging, but it’s doable, Kulikowski said, pointing to a successful Doctors Without Borders rescue of 440 people in stormy seas in the central Mediterranean in April.

Best practices include distributing life jackets and flotation devices in case people fall in; dispatching small boats from the main rescue ship to approach on two sides, to avoid people rushing to one side and tipping their vessel; establishing a clear communication channel from these rescue boats to the vessel to give instructions in multiple languages; and evacuating people to the mother ship in smaller groups over multiple trips if necessary.

Video footage and weather data show clear skies and calm seas on June 13. “The weather conditions look like they’re really sublime here,” Davenport said. “There’s not a lot of wind, there’s not a lot of waves, light current.”

Attempting a rescue of the Adriana “would have been absolutely safe” in these conditions, according to an Italian official familiar with that country’s search-and-rescue protocols, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely.

Greece is likely to face legal challenges over its actions — or inaction. But families of victims who drowned probably have a long wait for answers and accountability: Cases brought to the European Court of Human Rights, the most common avenue for prosecution beyond domestic courts, often take years to reach a judgment.

Did the actions of the coast guard cause the boat to capsize?

Less than a month after an overcrowded fishing trawler crammed with about 700 migrants sank off the coast of Greece, many relatives are still waiting for information and certainty.

Thirty-two-year-old Ali Shan from Pakistan hopes that his nephew survived the disaster, in which hundreds of migrants lost their lives.

Shan provided the Greek authorities with a DNA sample and has been waiting for news ever since. ""They only ever say that I have to wait. Nothing more,"" he told DW. ""There is a lot of talk in Europe about humanity. Are we not all humans?""

Ali Shan is convinced that many more people could have been rescued. The fishing trawler Andriana capsized and sank in the Ionian Sea off the coast of Pylos on June 14. Most of those on board perished; only 104 were saved.

International journalists investigate incident

An international media research team comprising staff from the British newspaper The Guardian, the German broadcaster Norddeutsche Rundfunk (NDR) and the Greek investigative medium Solomon spoke to 26 survivors, examined court documents, compared satellite data and log entries, and studied video footage from merchant ships.

Using the data collected, the Berlin-based research agency Forensis prepared a computer simulation of the Andriana's final hours. This simulation raises serious questions about the Greek coast guard's official account of the tragedy.

Differing accounts of what happened

The research indicates that the trawler drifted around for hours, before heading west shortly after encountering Boat 920 of the Greek coast guard authority. Survivors told the research team that the Greek coast guard guided them in that direction and assured them that a boat belonging to the Italian coast guard would be waiting for them in Italian waters.

The Greek coast guard said that the people on the trawler proceeded towards Italy of their own volition. Research conducted by the BBC published on June 18, which was based on data from a website that analyzes the movement of ships, had already raised questions about the official account given by the Greek coast guard.

What caused the trawler to capsize?

Statements made by survivors about the capsizing of the boat are even more incriminating. They claim that the trawler only capsized when the Greek coast guard tried to tow the completely overcrowded boat, which was incapable of maneuvering on its own, with a rope.

Two survivors who spoke to the journalists described how the Greek coast guard secured a rope to the trawler. Other survivors, who were below deck, reported feeling a heavy pull that could be explained by an attempt to tow the trawler.

The Greek coast guard has denied these allegations and said it offered to assist the overcrowded boat and passed the rope to the people on the trawler. It says that it did not tow the boat or cause it to capsize by doing so.

Offers of Frontex support ignored

It is not clear why the Greek coast guard simply ignored three offers of support from Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, and why the entire operation was not filmed.

Ninety percent of the funding for the coast guard's boat comes from the EU, and the vessel is equipped with cameras, which — according to the research of the investigative team — require little operation. The Greek coast guard has said that it preferred to concentrate on saving people rather than on filming what was happening.

When contacted by DW for a statement, Frontex pointed to the ongoing investigation. It said that the incident was being investigated by its Fundamental Rights Officer and was not willing to comment on the issue of the unused cameras.

EU Commission calls for transparent probe

In Greece, the incident is being investigated by the state attorney's office. Migration Minister Dimitris Kairidis has rejected the accusations and pointed out that it was the Greek coast guard that saved people, not any NGOs, foreign journalists or MEPs. ""We are humanitarian, but we are not naive,"" he said.

For years, media and international aid organizations have been reporting on the illegal pushback of migrants by Greek authorities. Many are calling for an independent monitoring mechanism on the EU's external borders, among other things because the responsible investigating institutions in Greece are not independent.

Commissioner wants 'full clarity'

EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson is very familiar with these problems. Despite numerous pieces of circumstantial evidence and proof of illegal behavior by the Greek authorities in recent years, she has yet to launch an infringement procedure against Greece or issue any kind of public admonition. After the disaster, her press office stated that Greece was legally responsible for investigating the incident.

When contacted by DW, her office said that she had spoken to the new Greek interior minister and called for ""full clarity about the facts, to establish, via a swift, thorough and transparent investigation, what has exactly happened"" with a view to prosecuting any wrongdoing.

Green MEP calls for tougher approach

For Green MEP Erik Marquardt, statements like these are worth little. He calls on both the EU Commission and member states to take tougher action. Apart from expressions of condolence, he says, there was no major response to the disaster.

Marquardt says that little interest was being shown in clearing up the many open questions relating to the Greek coast guard and its role in the incident: ""How is democracy supposed to function when EU member states in such cases lie in plain sight and no one says anything?"" Marquardt told DW.

For Marquardt, this is not only a matter of safeguarding the rights of asylum seekers, but also of protecting the rule of law in the EU. ""A country where certain groups do not have any rights will at some point become a country where no one has access to justice anymore,"" said Marquardt. Once that point is reached, he added, it is no longer legislation and the parliaments that shape law and order, but those in power alone.

At least 209 Pakistanis were among those who lost their lives in the boat wreck off Greece last week, according to data shared by a Pakistani investigative agency.

Information provided to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) by families of missing passengers known to have boarded the boat that capsized off Greece’s coast suggests the death toll may be significantly higher than official figures.

Greek authorities say the number of victims stands at 82 and the number of survivors at 104, of whom 12 were Pakistanis.

“An investigation to verify this is under way,” FIA Islamabad Zone Director Rana Abdul Jabbar told the Reuters news agency.

Data shared with the news agency showed that 181 among the missing passengers were from Pakistan and 28 from Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

The FIA was tasked by the Pakistani government with handling investigations into the tragedy.

Pakistan is yet to officially confirm how many of its citizens were on the boat but kick-started a DNA sampling effort to help Greece identify those who died. Officials gathered DNA samples from 201 families.

Hundreds of people of different nationalities, including Egyptians, Syrians and Palestinians, are believed to have been on board the vessel, in what is seen as the worst sea disaster in years for the region.

Witness accounts suggested that between 400 and 750 people had crammed onto the 20- to 30 metre-long (65- to 100-foot) fishing boat which then capsized and sank early on June 14 about 80km (50 miles) from the southern coastal town of Pylos.

The FIA said 29 suspected human smugglers had been arrested in Pakistan so far over the case.

Family members told Al Jazeera they paid 2.2 million Pakistani rupees ($7,718) for each of the travellers to “agents” who provide documentation for people looking to find financial opportunities abroad.

Among the Syrians still missing is a father who was desperately seeking cancer treatment for his son, Al Jazeera has learned.

Thaer al-Rahal, a 39-year-old who hails from the city of Inkhil, in the Daraa countryside, was a resident of the sprawling Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan.

“Thaer did not like the idea of travelling to Europe, and he always dreamed of returning to his hometown. But the search for a cure for his son who had cancer prompted him to turn to the treacherous sea,” his cousin, Abdul Rahman al-Rahal, told Al Jazeera.

The tragedy off the coast of Greece was the third major incident recorded since February in which migrants and refugees from Pakistan lost their lives at sea.",True,"['Refugee', 'Death', 'Migrant', 'Missing', 'Boat']"

Greek authorities have been accused of failing to rescue hundreds of refugees and migrants onboard a vessel that sunk near the coastal town of Pylos, causing one of the biggest tragedies in the Mediterranean Sea.

Reports suggest as many as 750 people were packed onto the fishing boat that capsized early on Wednesday in deep waters about 80km (50 miles) off the southern Peloponnese peninsula.

At least 78 bodies have been recovered and 104 people rescued. Hundreds are still missing.

The Greek coastguard was alerted to the presence of the vessel about 10am (08:00 GMT) on Tuesday. It capsized later that evening.

Exactly what happened in the intervening hours remains unclear.

Alarm Phone, a self-organised hotline for refugees in distress in the Mediterranean Sea, says the boat had reported being in trouble, but Greek authorities say it repeatedly refused offers of help.

Here is a timeline of the events that occurred on Tuesday, according to statements issued by Alarm Phone and Greek authorities:

9:53am (07:53 GMT): Activist Nawal Soufi, based in Italy, alerts Alarm Phone of a large boat in distress carrying 750 people. Over the following hours, Soufi sends additional information, including the GPS position of the vessel. She says authorities in Italy, Greece and Malta were alerted.

12:47 pm (10:47 GMT): A surveillance aircraft from the European Border and Coast Guard Agency Frontex spots the overcrowded trawler at and notifies Greek authorities.

The Greek coastguard confirms it was notified of the boat’s presence late on Tuesday morning.

2:17pm (12:17 GMT): Alarm Phone receives the first call from the boat. Its passengers say they are in distress and “cannot survive the night”. The call drops before the GPS coordinates can be confirmed.

Greek authorities say in their statement that they established contact with someone on the trawler at around 2pm. The vessel “did not request any assistance from the Coast Guard or from Greece,” they say.

3:35pm (1:35 GMT): A Greek Coast Guard helicopter located the trawler. An aerial photo released showed it packed, with people covering almost every inch of the deck. Some had their hands outstretched.

4:13pm (14:13 GMT): After a number of failed attempts at communicating with the boat, Alarm Phone receives the coordinates.

4:53pm (14:53 GMT): The organisation alerts the Greek authorities via email as well as other actors, including the EU border agency, Frontex, and UN refugee agency in Greece.

5:10pm (15:10 GMT): Greek authorities ask a Maltese-flagged tanker called the Lucky Sailor to bring the trawler food and water.

According to the company that manages the Lucky Sailor, people on the boat “were very hesitant to receive any assistance,” and shouted that “they want to go to Italy.”

Eastern Mediterranean Maritime Limited said in a statement that the trawler was later persuaded to accept supplies.

5:20pm (15:20 GMT): The passengers call Alarm Phone saying the boat is not moving and the captain fled on a smaller boat. They add that they need food and water.

6:30pm (16:30 GMT): The Greek coastguard says it observed the boat by helicopter and it was “sailing on a steady course”.

Greek officials say they were faced with a dilemma on what to do with a vessel that had repeatedly declined offers of assistance as they worried that even the slightest shift could unbalance the boat.

6:55pm (16:55 GMT): Soufi writes that migrants on board tell her six people died and another two were very sick. No other account has mentioned deaths prior to the shipwreck.

8:05pm (18:05 GMT): Alarm Phone is informed by the passengers that they received water from the merchant vessel Lucky Sailor and they have been in contact with the police. Alarm Phone also notices that a second merchant vessel, the Faithful Warrior, is close to the boat.

9:00pm (19:00 GMT): Greek authorities say they asked a second, Greek-flagged, merchant vessel to deliver water, and allowed the Lucky Sailor to leave.

10:40pm (20:40 GMT): A Coast Guard boat from Crete reaches the trawler and remains nearby until it sank. According to the Coast Guard, the vessel “discreetly observed” the trawler from a distance. Once again, the Coast Guard said, the trawler did not appear to have any problems and was moving “at a steady course and speed.”

11:00pm (21:00 GMT): Shortly after 11pm, Soufi writes that the trawler began rocking as its passengers tried to catch water bottles from another vessel. According to people on board, ropes were tied to the ship, destabilising it and causing a “state of panic,” she said.

12:46am Wednesday (22:46 GMT): Alarm Phone reports its last contact with the boat in distress. All it hears is: “Hello, my friend. … The ship you send is …” The call cuts off.

The Greek coastguard says merchant ships delivered supplies and observed the vessel until the morning when the satellite phone user reports a problem with the engine.

About 40 minutes later, according to the coastguard statement, the vessel began to rock violently and sank.

The Greek coastguard says the boat’s engine stopped working shortly before 1am on Wednesday (23:00 GMT Tuesday) and the vessel later capsized, sinking in about 10 to 15 minutes.

Who says what?

Coastguard experts believe the boat may have run out of fuel or experienced engine trouble and the movement of passengers caused it to list and capsize.

They suggest the boat might have capsized earlier had they attempted to intervene.

But Greece’s leftist former Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras says the passengers had “called for help”.

“What sort of protocol does not call for the rescue … of an overloaded boat about to sink?” he asked.

Soufi says in a reconstruction posted on Facebook that the Greek coastguard had been towing the ship before it capsized.

According to messages between Soufi and the passengers, the Greek coastguard tied a rope to the fishing vessel.

The activist said later in a voice memo that “they never expressed the will to continue sailing to Italy,” or refused assistance from Greece. “They were in danger and needed help.”

Greek parliamentarian Kriton Arsenis, who spoke to some survivors in Kalamata, confirms the account and accuses the coastguard of trying to move the boat into Italian waters.

Greek authorities did not mention any attempt to tow the boat in their statements following the shipwreck.

The report from the Lucky Sailor said no lines were tied to the trawler, and supplies were delivered in watertight barrels tied to a rope.

Commander Nikos Alexiou told Greek channel Ant1 TV that the Coast Guard wanted to check on the trawler’s condition, but people on board again refused help and untied the rope before continuing course.",True,"['Refugee', 'Death', 'Migrant', 'Missing', 'Boat', 'Rescue']"
